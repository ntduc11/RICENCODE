## Key message
1. __anther__, [The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis, Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants
2. __cell death__, [Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development%5BTitle%5D)),  These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1)
3. __anther development__, [Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development%5BTitle%5D)),  While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development
4. __meiosis__, [The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
5. __tapetum__, [Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the identification of rice (Oryza sativa) Undeveloped Tapetum1 (Udt1), which is required for the differentiation of secondary parietal cells to mature tapetal cells, DNA microarray analysis identified 958 downregulated and 267 upregulated genes in the udt1-1 anthers, suggesting that Udt1 plays a major role in maintaining tapetum development, starting in early meiosis
6. __transcription factor__, [Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Undeveloped Tapetum1 is a major regulator of early tapetum development%5BTitle%5D)),  This, together with its homology with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins, suggests that UDT1 is a transcription factor
