## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the ONION1 (ONI1) gene, which encodes a fatty acid elongase (beta-ketoacyl CoA synthase) involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids, is required for correct fatty acid composition and normal shoot development in rice, oni1 mutants containing a reduced amount of very-long-chain fatty acids produced very small shoots, with an aberrant outermost epidermal cell layer, and ceased to grow soon after germination, ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
2. __shoot apical meristem__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
3. __meristem__, [Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Fatty acid elongase is required for shoot development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ONI1 was specifically expressed in the outermost cell layer of the shoot apical meristem and developing lateral organs
