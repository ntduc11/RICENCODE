## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " In this study, a rice NAC gene, ONAC045, was functionally characterized, especially with regard to its role in abiotic stress resistance"
2. __temperature__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots"
3. __transcription factor__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice
4. __root__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots
5. __drought__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots, Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments, Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice"
6. __salt__, [Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a NAC transcription factor enhances rice drought and salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression analysis revealed that ONAC045 was induced by drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in leaves and roots, Transgenic rice plants overexpressing ONAC045 showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt treatments, Together, these results suggest that ONAC045 encodes a novel stress-responsive NAC transcription factor and is potential useful for engineering drought and salt tolerant rice"
