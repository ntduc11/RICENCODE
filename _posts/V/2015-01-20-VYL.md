## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period, VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development
2. __growth__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  In this work, we isolated a virescent yellow leaf (vyl) mutant in rice (Oryza sativa), which produces chlorotic leaves throughout the entire growth period
3. __chloroplast__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Positional cloning revealed that the VYL gene encodes a protein homologous to the Arabidopsis ClpP6 subunit and that it is targeted to the chloroplast, VYL expression is constitutive in most tissues examined but most abundant in leaf sections containing chloroplasts in early stages of development

## Connection
1. __CLPP4__, __VYL__, [A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice virescent-yellow leaf mutant reveals new insights into the role and assembly of plastid caseinolytic protease in higher plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Using a tandem affinity purification approach and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified OsClpP4 as a VYL-associated protein in vivo, In addition, yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that VYL directly interacts with OsClpP3 and OsClpP4
