## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study, we isolated a gene encoding rice Mlo (Oryza sativa Mlo; OsMlo) using a protein-protein interaction-based screening of a cDNA expression library constructed from pathogen-elicited rice suspension cells |  Expression of OsMlo was strongly induced by a fungal pathogen and by plant defense signaling molecules  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
