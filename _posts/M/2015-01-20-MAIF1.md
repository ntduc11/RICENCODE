## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth
2. __root__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth, These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth, Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
3. __auxin__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
4. __growth__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth, These results suggest that MAIF1 is involved in multiple signaling pathways in regulating root growth, Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
5. __abiotic stress__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MAIF1 expression is induced rapidly and strongly by abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses, Overexpression of MAIF1 reduces rice ABA sensitivity and abiotic stress tolerance and promotes rice root growth, Our results also suggest that MAIF1 plays the negative role in response to abiotic stress possibly by regulating root growth
6. __cytokinin__, [Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of an F-box protein gene reduces abiotic stress tolerance and promotes root growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  MAIF1 expression is also induced in root tips by sucrose, independent of its hydrolytic hexose products, glucose and fructose, and the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin
