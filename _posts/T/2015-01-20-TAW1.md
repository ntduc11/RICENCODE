## Key message
1. __inflorescence__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1) activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in the generation of small inflorescences, We thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity and suppression of the phase change to SM identity
2. __spikelet__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, reductions in TAWAWA1 (TAW1) activity cause precocious IM abortion and spikelet formation, resulting in the generation of small inflorescences, TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs)
3. __shoot__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs
4. __spikelet meristem__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs)
5. __shoot apical meristem__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs
6. __meristem__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  TAW1 encodes a nuclear protein of unknown function and shows high levels of expression in the shoot apical meristem, the IM, and the BMs, TAW1 expression disappears from incipient spikelet meristems (SMs), We thus propose that TAW1 is a unique regulator of meristem activity in rice and regulates inflorescence development through the promotion of IM activity and suppression of the phase change to SM identity
7. __vegetative__, [TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAWAWA1, a regulator of rice inflorescence architecture, functions through the suppression of meristem phase transition%5BTitle%5D)),  We also demonstrate that members of the SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE subfamily of MADS-box genes function downstream of TAW1
