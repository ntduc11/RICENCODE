## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice
2. __erect__, [TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  TAC1 was mapped to a 35-kb region on chromosome 9 using a large F(2) population from crosses between an indica rice, IR24, which displays a relatively spread-out plant architecture, and an introgressed line, IL55, derived from japonica rice Asominori, which displays a compact plant architecture with extremely erect tillers
3. __shoot__, [Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsPIN2 leads to increased tiller numbers, angle and shorter plant height through suppression of OsLAZY1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPIN2-over-expressing plants had suppressed the expression of a gravitropism-related gene OsLazy1 in the shoots, but unaltered expression of OsPIN1b and OsTAC1, which were reported as tiller angle controllers in rice, The data suggest that OsPIN2 has a distinct auxin-dependent regulation pathway together with OsPIN1b and OsTAC1 controlling rice shoot architecture
4. __tiller__, [Molecular evolution of the TAC1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular evolution of the TAC1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Our previous work identified Tiller Angle Control 1 (TAC1) as a major quantitative trait locus that controls rice tiller angle
5. __architecture__, [TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(TAC1, a major quantitative trait locus controlling tiller angle in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  TAC1 was mapped to a 35-kb region on chromosome 9 using a large F(2) population from crosses between an indica rice, IR24, which displays a relatively spread-out plant architecture, and an introgressed line, IL55, derived from japonica rice Asominori, which displays a compact plant architecture with extremely erect tillers,5-kb intron from 'AGGA' to 'GGGA' decreases the level of tac1, resulting in a compact plant architecture with a tiller angle close to zero

10. __domestication__, [Molecular evolution of the TAC1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular evolution of the TAC1 gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), 00112, respectively, further indicate that TAC1 has been highly conserved during the course of rice domestication, A phylogenetic tree derived from TAC1 sequence analysis suggests that the indica and japonica subspecies arose independently during the domestication of wild rice
