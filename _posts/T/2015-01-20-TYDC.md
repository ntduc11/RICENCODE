## Expression information

## Key message
1. __growth__, [Characterization of rice tryptophan decarboxylases and their direct involvement in serotonin biosynthesis in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of rice tryptophan decarboxylases and their direct involvement in serotonin biosynthesis in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The overproduction of TYDC resulted in stunted growth and a lack of seed production due to tyramine accumulation, which increased as the plant aged
