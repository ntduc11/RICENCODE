## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, additional evidence is provided that the expression of OsC6 is positively regulated by a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, Tapetum Degeneration Retardation (TDR)
2. __anther__, [Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development%5BTitle%5D)),  While the GAMYB expression was not obviously changed in tdr and udt1-1, and no apparent expression fold change of UDT1 in tdr and gamyb-4, suggesting that TDR may act downstream of GAMYB and UDT1, and GAMYB and UDT1 work in parallel to regulate rice early anther development
3. __tapetum__, [High temperatures cause male sterility in rice plants with transcriptional alterations during pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(High temperatures cause male sterility in rice plants with transcriptional alterations during pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression levels of Osc6, OsRAFTIN and TDR, which are tapetum-specific genes, were unaffected by high temperatures
4. __cell death__, [Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of gamyb-4 and analysis of the regulatory role of GAMYB in rice anther development%5BTitle%5D)),  These results revealed that the expression of TDR (TAPETUM DEGENERATION RETARDATION), a tapetal cell death regulator, was downregulated in gamyb-4 and udt1 (undeveloped tapetum1)
