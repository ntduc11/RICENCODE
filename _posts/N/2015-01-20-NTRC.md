## Key message
1. __oxidative__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)), " We propose that NTRC constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power, Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power,Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage"
2. __photosynthesis__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light
3. __chloroplast__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that rice (Oryza sativa) chloroplast NADPH THIOREDOXIN REDUCTASE (NTRC), with a thioredoxin domain, uses NADPH to reduce the chloroplast 2-Cys peroxiredoxin BAS1, which then reduces hydrogen peroxide, An Arabidopsis thaliana knockout mutant for NTRC shows irregular mesophyll cell shape, abnormal chloroplast structure, and unbalanced BAS1 redox state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low light, We propose that NTRC constitutes an alternative system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage, using NADPH as the source of reducing power,Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage
4. __phosphate__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  Since no light-driven reduced ferredoxin is produced at night, the NTRC-BAS1 pathway may be a key detoxification system during darkness, with NADPH produced by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway as the source of reducing power
5. __senescence__, [Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NTRC is a high-efficiency redox system for chloroplast protection against oxidative damage%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by light/dark incubation produced an increase in hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation in leaves and accelerated senescence of NTRC-deficient plants
