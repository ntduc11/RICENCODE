## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
2. __senescence__, [Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defect in non-yellow coloring 3, an alpha/beta hydrolase-fold family protein, causes a stay-green phenotype during leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  nyc3 retained a higher chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content than the wild-type but showed a decrease in other senescence parameters during dark incubation, suggesting that it is a non-functional stay-green mutant, The chlorophyll content of nyc3 sgr double mutants at the late stage of leaf senescence was also similar to that of sgr
