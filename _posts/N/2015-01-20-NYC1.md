## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes, Map-based cloning of NYC1 revealed that it encodes a chloroplast-localized short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) with three transmembrane domains
2. __leaf__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence
3. __senescence__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of the nyc1 mutant, which shows the stay-green phenotype, revealed that chlorophyll b degradation is required for the degradation of light-harvesting complex II and thylakoid grana in leaf senescence,Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice
4. __senescence__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  non-yellow coloring1 (nyc1) is a rice (Oryza sativa) stay-green mutant in which chlorophyll degradation during senescence is impaired, Pigment analysis revealed that degradation of not only chlorophylls but also light-harvesting complex II (LHCII)-bound carotenoids was repressed in nyc1, in which most LHCII isoforms were selectively retained during senescence, Ultrastructural analysis of nyc1 chloroplasts revealed that large and thick grana were present even in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that degradation of LHCII is required for the proper degeneration of thylakoid membranes, Our data collectively suggest that the identified SDR protein NYC1 plays essential roles in the regulation of LHCII and thylakoid membrane degradation during senescence

## Connection
1. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases, NON-YELLOW COLORING 1 and NYC1-LIKE, are required for chlorophyll b and light-harvesting complex II degradation during senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Phylogenetic analysis further revealed the existence of NYC1-LIKE (NOL) as the most closely related protein to NYC1, In the present paper, the nol mutant in rice was also found to show a stay-green phenotype very similar to that of the nyc1 mutant, i, The nyc1 nol double mutant did not show prominent enhancement of inhibition of chlorophyll degradation, Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NOL and NYC1 interact physically in vitro, These observations suggest that NOL and NYC1 are co-localized in the thylakoid membrane and act in the form of a complex as a chlorophyll b reductase in rice
2. __NOL__, __NYC1__, [Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice NON-YELLOW COLORING1 is involved in light-harvesting complex II and grana degradation during leaf senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  Although we were unable to detect the chlorophyll b reductase activity of NYC1, NOL (for NYC1-like), a protein closely related to NYC1 in rice, showed chlorophyll b reductase activity in vitro, We suggest that NYC1 and NOL encode chlorophyll b reductases with divergent functions
