## Connection
1. __FON2~FON4__, __FOS1__, [FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FON2 SPARE1 redundantly regulates floral meristem maintenance with FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the FON2 SPARE1 (FOS1) gene encoding a CLE protein functions along with FON2 in maintenance of the FM, Genetic analysis revealed that FOS1 does not need FON1, the putative receptor of FON2, for its action, suggesting that FOS1 and FON2 may function in meristem maintenance as signaling molecules in independent pathways, Sequence comparison of FOS1 in about 150 domesticated rice and wild rice species indicates that this FNP is present only in japonica, suggesting that redundant regulation by FOS1 and FON2 is commonplace in species in the Oryza genus
2. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __FON2~FON4__, [Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two proteins closely related to CLAVATA3, FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER2 (FON2) and FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (FCP1/Os CLE402), have functionally diversified to regulate the different types of meristem in rice (Oryza sativa), Unlike FON2, which regulates the maintenance of flower and inflorescence meristems, FCP1 appears to regulate the maintenance of the vegetative SAM and RAM, FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions, Furthermore, we identify a key amino acid residue that discriminates between the actions of FCP1 and FON2
3. __FON1__, __FON2~FON4__, [Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  FON1, a putative receptor of FON2, is likely to be unnecessary for these FCP1 functions
