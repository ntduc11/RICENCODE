## Expression information

## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
2. __seedling__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
3. __growth__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase
4. __shoot__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase, Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
5. __meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period
6. __shoot__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period
7. __meristem__, [The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice flattened shoot meristem, encoding CAF-1 p150 subunit, is required for meristem maintenance by regulating the cell-cycle period%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated flattened shoot meristem (fsm) mutants in rice that showed defective seedling growth and died in the vegetative phase, Since most fsm plants had flat and small shoot apical meristems (SAMs), we suggest that FSM is required for proper SAM maintenance
