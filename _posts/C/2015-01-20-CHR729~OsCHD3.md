## Key message
1. __seedling__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.
2. __seedling__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway
3. __development__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.

5. __gibberellin__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway
6. __R protein__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  CHR729 encoded a nuclear protein and was expressed in almost all organs
7. __Gibberellin__, [CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHR729 Is a CHD3 Protein That Controls Seedling Development in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the rice CHD3 protein CHR729 plays an important role in many aspects of seedling development and controls this development via the gibberellin pathway

## Connection
1. __CHR729~OsCHD3__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Histone H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 regulatory genes control stable transmission of an epimutation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that maintenance of a stably hypomethylated active epiallele in rice required a CHD3 protein (CHR729) and that over-expression of an H3K4me3 demethylase (JMJ703) or H3K27me3 methyltransferase (SDG711) could stably resilence the epiallele
