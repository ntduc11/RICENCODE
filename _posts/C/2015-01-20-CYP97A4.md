## Expression information

## Key message
1. __sheath__, [Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
2. __spikelet__, [Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
3. __chloroplast__, [Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
4. __leaf__, [Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice carotenoid beta-ring hydroxylase CYP97A4 is involved in lutein biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that CYP97A4 was preferentially expressed in leaf compared with spikelet, sheath, stalk and root, and encoded a protein localized at the subcellular level to the chloroplasts
