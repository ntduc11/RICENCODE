## Key message
1. __leaf erectness__, [Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role  in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell proliferation.
2. __cell proliferation__, [Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrated that CYC U4;1 plays a positive role  in promoting leaf erectness by controlling the abaxial sclerenchyma cell proliferation.
3. __Brassinosteroid Signaling__, [Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation
4. __Brassinosteroid__, [Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation
5. __BR signaling__, [Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroid Signaling Regulates Leaf Erectness in Oryza sativa via the Control of a Specific U-Type Cyclin and Cell Proliferation%5BTitle%5D)), Furthermore, BR signaling inhibits the abaxial sclerenchyma cell division by coordinately regulating CYC U4;1 expression through BES1 and CYC U4;1 protein activity through GSK3 kinases.
