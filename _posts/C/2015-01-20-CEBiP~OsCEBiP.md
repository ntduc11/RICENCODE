## Connection
1. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __LYP4~OsLYP4__, [OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
2. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __LYP6~OsLYP6__, [OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 play critical roles in rice defense signal transduction%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, we found that OsLYP4 and OsLYP6 could form homo- and hetero-dimers, and could interact with CEBiP, suggesting an unexpected complexity of chitin perception in rice
3. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __OsCERK1__, [Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A plasma membrane glycoprotein, CEBiP (chitin elicitor binding protein) and a receptor kinase, CERK1 (chitin elicitor receptor kinase) (also known as LysM-RLK1), were identified as critical components for chitin signaling in rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, We report here that rice cells require a LysM receptor-like kinase, OsCERK1, in addition to CEBiP, for chitin signaling, The results of a yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that both CEBiP and OsCERK1 have the potential to form hetero- or homo-oligomers, Immunoprecipitation using a membrane preparation from rice cells treated with chitin oligosaccharides suggested the ligand-induced formation of a receptor complex containing both CEBiP and OsCERK1,Two LysM receptor molecules, CEBiP and OsCERK1, cooperatively regulate chitin elicitor signaling in rice
4. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __OsCERK1__, [OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCERK1 and OsRLCK176 play important roles in peptidoglycan and chitin signaling in rice innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)), OsCERK1 associated with OsLYP4 or OsLYP6 when induced by PGN but it associated with OsLYP4, OsLYP6, or CEBiP under chitin treatment, suggesting the presence of different patterns of ligand-induced heterooligomeric receptor complexes.
5. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __OsCERK1__, [The bifunctional plant receptor, OsCERK1, regulates both chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The bifunctional plant receptor, OsCERK1, regulates both chitin-triggered immunity and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, a KO mutant of OsCEBiP, which forms a receptor complex with OsCERK1 and is essential for chitin-triggered immunity, established mycorrhizal symbiosis normally
