## Key message
1. __grain__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The cap1 heterozygous plant produced equal numbers of normal and collapsed abnormal grains, A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains
2. __cell wall__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate
3. __growth__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
4. __anther__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage
5. __pollen__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We isolated a pollen-defective mutant, collapsed abnormal pollen1 (cap1), from Tos17 insertional mutant lines of rice (Oryza sativa), A wild-type genomic DNA segment containing CAP1 restored mutants to normal pollen grains, During rice pollen development, CAP1 was preferentially expressed in anthers at the bicellular pollen stage, and the effects of the cap1 mutation were mainly detected at this stage, Based on the metabolic pathway of l-arabinose, cap1 pollen phenotype may have been caused by toxic accumulation of l-arabinose or by inhibition of cell wall metabolism due to the lack of UDP-l-arabinose derived from l-arabinose 1-phosphate, Our results suggested that CAP1 and related genes are critical for pollen development in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants
6. __vegetative__, [Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Collapsed abnormal pollen1 gene encoding the Arabinokinase-like protein is involved in pollen development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analysis of crosses revealed that the cap1 mutation did not affect female reproduction or vegetative growth
