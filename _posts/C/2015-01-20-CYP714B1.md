## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism
2. __insect__, [CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro
3. __gibberellin__, [CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)), CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice
4. __ ga __, [CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice, These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice

## Connection
1. __CYP714B1__, __CYP714B2__, [CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that two cytochrome P450 genes, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2, encode GA 13-oxidase in rice, Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpress CYP714B1 or CYP714B2 show semidwarfism, Functional analysis using yeast or insect cells shows that recombinant CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 proteins can convert GA(12) into GA(53) (13-OH GA(12)) in vitro, Moreover, the levels of 13-OH GAs including GA(1) were decreased, whereas those of 13-H GAs including GA(4) (which is more active than GA(1)) were increased, in the rice cyp714b1 cyp714b2 double mutant, These results indicate that CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 play a predominant role in GA 13-hydroxylation in rice, Moreover, CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 expression was up-regulated by exogenous application of bioactive GAs,CYP714B1 and CYP714B2 encode gibberellin 13-oxidases that reduce gibberellin activity in rice
