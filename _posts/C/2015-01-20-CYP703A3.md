## Key message
1. __ ga __, [Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation
2. __tapetal__, [Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation

## Connection
1. __CYP703A3__, __OsMYBGA~OsGAMYB__, [Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin modulates anther development in rice via the transcriptional regulation of GAMYB%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, a knockout mutant for CYP703A3 showed gamyb-like defects in exine and Ubisch body formation, Together, these results suggest that GA regulates exine formation and the PCD of tapetal cells and that direct activation of CYP703A3 by GAMYB is key to exine formation
