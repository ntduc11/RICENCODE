## Information
__Symbol__: CYP93G1  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os04g01140](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g01140)  
__RAPdb__: [Os04g0101400](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os04g0101400)  

## Publication
1. [Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Consistently, transgenic expression of CYP93G1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in the accumulation of different flavone O-glycosides, which are not naturally present in cruciferous plants  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message

## Connection
1. __CYP93G1__, __CYP93G2__, [Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cytochrome P450 93G1 Is a Flavone Synthase II That Channels Flavanones to the Biosynthesis of Tricin O-Linked Conjugates in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we demonstrate that CYP93G1, the closest homolog of CYP93G2 in rice, is a bona fide flavone synthase II (FNSII) that catalyzes the direct conversion of flavanones to flavones
