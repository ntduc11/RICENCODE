## Connection
1. __CYCLOPS~OsIPD3__, __OsCCaMK~OsDMI3__, [CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation%5BTitle%5D)),  This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules, Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK, We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation, Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro, Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
