6. __CYP99A2__, __CYP99A3__, [CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYP99A3: functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Strikingly, the rice genome contains a biosynthetic gene cluster for momilactone production, located on rice chromosome 4, which contains two cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenases, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, with undefined roles; although it has been previously shown that RNA interference double knock-down of this pair of closely related CYPs reduced momilactone accumulation, Here we attempted biochemical characterization of CYP99A2 and CYP99A3, which was ultimately achieved by complete gene recoding, enabling functional recombinant expression in bacteria, With these synthetic gene constructs it was possible to demonstrate that while CYP99A2 does not exhibit significant activity with diterpene substrates, CYP99A3 catalyzes consecutive oxidations of the C19 methyl group of the momilactone precursor syn-pimara-7,15-diene to form, sequentially, syn-pimaradien-19-ol, syn-pimaradien-19-al, and syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid
7. __CYP99A2__, __DPF__, [Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Diterpenoid Phytoalexin Factor, a bHLH Transcription Factor, Plays a Central Role in the Biosynthesis of Diterpenoid Phytoalexins in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, DPF partly regulates CYP99A2 through the N-box
