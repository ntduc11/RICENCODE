[Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2013, Plant Cell.

## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
2. __meiotic__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Additionally, we provide evidence that CRC1 is essential for meiotic DSB formation, We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes

## Connection
1. __CRC1__, __PAIR1__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
2. __CRC1__, __PAIR2__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
3. __CRC1__, __ZEP1__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  CRC1 colocalizes with ZEP1, the rice SC transverse filament protein, to the central region of SCs in a mutually dependent fashion, Consistent with this colocalization, CRC1 interacts with ZEP1 in yeast two-hybrid assays
