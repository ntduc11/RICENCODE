## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
2. __transcription factor__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
3. __chloroplast__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Coexpression, microarray, and real-time expression analyses demonstrate a correlation between Cga1 expression and the expression of important nucleus-encoded, chloroplast-localized genes, Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling, Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index, These results indicate a conserved mechanism by which Cga1 regulates chloroplast development in higher plants
4. __senescence__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
5. __dwarf__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
6. __biomass__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Growing the transgenic lines under different nitrogen regimes indicates potential agricultural applications for Cga1, including manipulation of biomass, chlorophyll/chloroplast content, and harvest index

8. __tillering__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Strong overexpression of Cga1 produces dark green, semidwarf plants with reduced tillering, whereas RNA interference knockdown results in reduced chlorophyll and increased tillering
9. __cytokinin__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), the CYTOKININ-RESPONSIVE GATA TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (Cga1) shows increased expression following light, nitrogen, and cytokinin treatments, while darkness and gibberellin reduce expression
10. __grain filling__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
11. __grain__, [Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice cytokinin GATA transcription Factor1 regulates chloroplast development and plant architecture%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive Cga1 overexpression increases both chloroplast biogenesis and starch production but also results in delayed senescence and reduced grain filling
