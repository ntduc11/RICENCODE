## Key message
1. __xylem__, [Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice expressing a reporter construct, BC6 promoter activity was detected in the culms, nodes, and flowers, and was localized primarily in xylem tissues
2. __cell wall__, [A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA9 affects cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA9 affects cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsCESA9 plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth

4. __growth__, [A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA9 affects cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A missense mutation in the transmembrane domain of CESA9 affects cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that OsCESA9 plays an important role in cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth

6. __cellulose__, [Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls%5BTitle%5D)),  Bc6 encodes a cellulose synthase catalytic subunit, OsCesA9, and has a missense mutation in its highly conserved region, In culms of the Bc6 mutant, the proportion of cellulose was reduced by 38%, while that of hemicellulose was increased by 34%, Introduction of the semi-dominant Bc6 mutant gene into wild-type rice significantly reduced the percentage of cellulose, causing brittle phenotypes, These results indicate that BC6 is a secondary cell wall-specific CesA that plays an important role in proper deposition of cellulose in the secondary cell walls
7. __flower__, [Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Brittle culm 6 encodes a dominant-negative form of CesA protein that perturbs cellulose synthesis in secondary cell walls%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice expressing a reporter construct, BC6 promoter activity was detected in the culms, nodes, and flowers, and was localized primarily in xylem tissues
