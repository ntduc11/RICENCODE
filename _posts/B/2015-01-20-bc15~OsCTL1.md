## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of BC15/OsCTL1 causes reduced cellulose content and mechanical strength without obvious alterations in plant growth, Investigation of the global expression profile of wild-type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling
2. __cell wall__, [Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Investigation of the global expression profile of wild-type and bc15 plants, using Illumina RNA sequencing, further suggested a possible mechanism by which BC15/OsCTL1 mediates cellulose biosynthesis and cell wall remodeling
3. __culm__, [Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brittle culm15 encodes a membrane-associated chitinase-like protein required for cellulose biosynthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report the isolation of a brittle culm mutant, bc15, and the map-based cloning of the BC15/OsCTL1 (for chitinase-like1) gene affected in the mutant
