## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Monosaccharide analysis of total and fractioned wall residues revealed that bc10 showed impaired cellulose biosynthesis, BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties
2. __vascular bundle__, [BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  BC10 is mainly expressed in the developing sclerenchyma and vascular bundle cells, and its deficiency causes a reduction in the levels of cellulose and AGPs, leading to inferior mechanical properties
3. __culm__, [BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and in-depth characterization of a brittle rice mutant, brittle culm 10 (bc10)
4. __growth__, [BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BC10, a DUF266-containing and Golgi-located type II membrane protein, is required for cell-wall biosynthesis in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  bc10 plants show pleiotropic phenotypes, including brittleness of the plant body and retarded growth
