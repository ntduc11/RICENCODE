## Publication
1. [BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BRHIS1 suppresses rice innate immunity through binding to monoubiquitinated H2A and H2B variants.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, EMBO Rep.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: The BRHIS1-containing complex represses the expression of some disease defense-related genes, including the pathogenesis-related gene OsPBZc and the leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) receptor-like protein kinase gene OsSIRK1 |  Our results show that rice disease defense genes are initially organized in an expression-ready state by specific monoubiquitination of H2A and H2B variants deposited on their promoter regions, but are kept suppressed by the BRHIS1 complex, facilitating the prompt initiation of innate immune responses in response to infection through the stringent regulation of BRHIS1
