2. __BAD1~OsBADH1__, __OsBADH2~fgr__, [Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dissecting substrate specificity of two rice BADH isoforms: Enzyme kinetics, docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies%5BTitle%5D)), Fragrance rice (Oryza sativa) contains two isoforms of BADH, named OsBADH1 and OsBADH2, OsBADH1 is implicated in acetaldehyde oxidation in rice plant peroxisomes, while the non-functional OsBADH2 is believed to be involved in the accumulation of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, the major compound of aroma in fragrance rice, Consistent with our previous study, kinetics data indicated that the enzymes catalyze the oxidation of GAB-ald more efficiently than Bet-ald and the OsBADH1 W172F and OsBADH2 W170F mutants displayed a higher catalytic efficiency towards GAB-ald, The amino acid residues, E262, L263, C296 and W461 of OsBADH1 and E260, L261, C294 and W459 of OsBADH2 located within 5 A of the OsBADH active site mainly interacted with GAB-ald forming strong hydrogen bonds in both OsBADH isoforms, Residues W163, N164, Q294, C296 and F397 of OsBADH1-Bet-ald and Y163, M167, W170, E260, S295 and C453 of OsBADH2-Bet-ald formed the main interaction sites while E260 showed an interaction energy of -14, Unconserved A290 in OsBADH1 and W288 in OsBADH2 appeared to be important for substrate recognition similar to that observed in PsAMADHs
