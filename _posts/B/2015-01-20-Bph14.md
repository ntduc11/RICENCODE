## Expression information

## Key message
1. __salicylic acid__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
2. __defense__, ["Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
3. __growth__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
4. __brown planthopper__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice
5. __defense response__, ["Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response
6. __vascular bundle__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Bph14 is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles, the site of BPH feeding
7. __insect__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Sequence comparison indicates that Bph14 carries a unique LRR domain that might function in recognition of the BPH insect invasion and activating the defense response, Expression of Bph14 activates the salicylic acid signaling pathway and induces callose deposition in phloem cells and trypsin inhibitor production after planthopper infestation, thus reducing the feeding, growth rate, and longevity of the BPH insects
8. __seedling__, [Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to brown planthopper in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we cloned Bph14, a gene conferring resistance to BPH at seedling and maturity stages of the rice plant, using a map-base cloning approach
