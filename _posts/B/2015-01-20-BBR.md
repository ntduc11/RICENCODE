## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf shape__, [The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3%5BTitle%5D)),  In co-transfection experiments, BBR activates (GA/TC)8-containing promoters, and its overexpression in tobacco leads to a pronounced leaf shape modification
2. __leaf__, [The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3%5BTitle%5D)),  In co-transfection experiments, BBR activates (GA/TC)8-containing promoters, and its overexpression in tobacco leads to a pronounced leaf shape modification
3. __transcription factor__, [The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The GA octodinucleotide repeat binding factor BBR participates in the transcriptional regulation of the homeobox geneBkn3%5BTitle%5D)),  The data presented suggest that expression of the barley BKn3 is regulated, at least in part, by the binding of the transcription factor BBR to GA/TC repeats
