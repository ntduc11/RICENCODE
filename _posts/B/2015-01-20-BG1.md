## Key message
1. __grain__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
2. __seed__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
3. __yield__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Manipulation of BG1 in both rice and Arabidopsis can enhance plant biomass, seed weight, and yield
4. __grain size__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of BG1 leads to significantly increased grain size, and the severe lines exhibit obviously perturbed gravitropism
5. __auxin__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains
6. __auxin__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, BG1 is specifically induced by auxin treatment, preferentially expresses in the vascular tissue of culms and young panicles, and encodes a novel membrane-localized protein, strongly suggesting its role in regulating auxin transport
7. __auxin transport__, [Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of Big Grain1 significantly improves grain size by regulating auxin transport in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the mutant has increased sensitivities to both auxin and N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an auxin transport inhibitor, whereas knockdown of BG1 results in decreased sensitivities and smaller grains
