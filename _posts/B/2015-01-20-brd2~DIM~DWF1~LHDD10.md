## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Our data showed that lhdd10 influences heading date by controlling the expression of heading date regulators, such as OsMADS50 in both LD and SD conditions |  lhdd10 also negatively regulated expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes to reduce the chlorophyll content  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
