## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Genetic control of a transition from black to straw-white seed hull in rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of a transition from black to straw-white seed hull in rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Bh4 encodes an amino acid transporter
2. __domestication__, [The role of Bh4 in parallel evolution of hull colour in domesticated and weedy rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of Bh4 in parallel evolution of hull colour in domesticated and weedy rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Tests for selection indicate that Asian crops and straw hull weeds deviate from neutrality at this gene, suggesting possible selection on Bh4 during both rice domestication and de-domestication
