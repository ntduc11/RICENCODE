## Publication
1. [SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SET DOMAIN GROUP 708, a histone H3 lysine 36-specific methyltransferase, controls flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa).%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, New Phytol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In fact, knockdown of SDG708 led to misexpression of a set of functional genes and a genome-wide decrease in H3K36me1/2/3 levels during the early growth stages of rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
