## Key message
1. __growth__, [The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes
2. __strigolactone__, [The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2, However, full arbuscule development in the strigolactone biosynthesis mutants d10 and d17 suggested strigolactones to be unlikely substrates of STR1/STR2
3. __transporter__, [The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutation of either of the Oryza sativa (rice) ABCG transporters blocked arbuscule growth of different AM fungi at a small and stunted stage, recapitulating the phenotype of Medicago truncatula stunted arbuscule 1 and 2 (str1 and str2) mutants that are deficient in homologous ABCG genes,The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice

5. __branching__, [The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The half-size ABC transporters STR1 and STR2 are indispensable for mycorrhizal arbuscule formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Strigolactones have previously been hypothesized to operate as intracellular hyphal branching signals and possible substrates of STR1 and STR2
