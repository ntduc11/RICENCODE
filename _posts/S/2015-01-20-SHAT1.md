## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice, Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4
2. __seed__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line, The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice
3. __shattering__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identified a seed shattering abortion1 (shat1) mutant in a wild rice introgression line, The SHAT1 gene, which encodes an APETALA2 transcription factor, is required for seed shattering through specifying abscission zone (AZ) development in rice
4. __spikelet__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification

## Connection
1. __sh4~SHA1__, __SHAT1__, [Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genetic control of seed shattering in rice by the APETALA2 transcription factor shattering abortion1%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analyses revealed that the expression of SHAT1 in AZ was positively regulated by the trihelix transcription factor SH4, Our results suggest a genetic model in which the persistent and concentrated expression of active SHAT1 and SH4 in the AZ during early spikelet developmental stages is required for conferring AZ identification, qSH1 functioned downstream of SHAT1 and SH4, through maintaining SHAT1 and SH4 expression in AZ, thus promoting AZ differentiation
2. __SH5__, __SHAT1__, [The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)), We also determined that two shattering-related genes, SHAT1 and Sh4, which are necessary for proper formation of an AZ, were induced by SH5.
