## Key message
1. __senescence__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves, Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin, This indicates that upregulation of SGR increases Chl breakdown during senescence in rice, A small quantity of chlorophyllide a accumulated in sgr leaves, but this also accumulated in wild-type rice leaves during senescence
2. __seedling__, [Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings, Transcriptome analyses using Affymetrix Rice GeneChips revealed that Ov-SGR rice seedlings exhibited a number of signs of singlet oxygen response,Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings
3. __oxidative__, [Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings
4. __leaf__, [The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence
5. __cytokinin__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin
6. __senescence__, [The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The Stay-Green Rice (SGR) protein is encoded by the SGR gene and has been shown to affect chlorophyll (Chl) degradation during natural and dark-induced leaf senescence, We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence, Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice
7. __chloroplast__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The gene, designated Stay Green Rice (SGR), was cloned by a positional cloning strategy encoding an ancient protein containing a putative chloroplast transit peptide
8. __senescence__, [Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)), It is thought that the Stay Green Rice (SGR) gene is involved in the disaggregation of the light harvesting complex and in the subsequent breakdown of chlorophyll and apo-protein during senescence
9. __cell death__, [Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we found that overexpression of SGR (Ov-SGR) resulted in the generation of singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species and produced a chlorophyll-dependent regional cell death phenotype on leaves of rice seedlings,Overexpression of SGR results in oxidative stress and lesion-mimic cell death in rice seedlings

## Connection
1. __OsSGRL__, __SGR__, [The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An SGR homologue, SGR-like (SGRL), has been detected in many plant species, We show that SGRL is primarily expressed in green tissues, and is significantly downregulated in rice leaves undergoing natural and dark-induced senescence, As the light intensity increases during the natural photoperiod, the intensity of SGRL expression declines while that of SGR expression increases, Overexpression of SGRL reduces the levels of Chl and Chl-binding proteins in leaves, and accelerates their degradation in dark-induced senescence leaves in rice, Our results suggest that the SGRL protein is also involved in Chl degradation, The relationship between SGRL and SGR and their effects on the degradation of the light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding protein are also discussed,The Stay-Green Rice like (SGRL) gene regulates chlorophyll degradation in rice
2. __OsPAO__, __SGR__, [Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and function analysis of the stay green gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  SGR, like the gene for pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO), was constitutively expressed, but was upregulated by dark-induced senescence in rice leaves, Senescence-induced expression of SGR and PaO was enhanced by ABA, but inhibited by cytokinin, According to these observations, we propose that SGR may be involved in regulating or taking part in the activity of PaO, and then may influence Chl breakdown and degradation of pigment-protein complex
3. __ONAC106__, __SGR__, [Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.%5BTitle%5D)),  Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
