## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein%5BTitle%5D)), A rice spotted leaf (lesion-mimic) gene, Spl7, was identified by map-based cloning, Transgenic analysis verified the function of the candidate gene for Spl7: leaf spot development was suppressed in spl7 mutants with a wild-type Spl7 transgene,A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein
2. __transcription factor__, [A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein%5BTitle%5D)), A rice spotted leaf gene, Spl7, encodes a heat stress transcription factor protein
3. __blast__, [Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor

## Connection
1. __SPL11__, __Spl7__, [Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulatory mechanisms of ROI generation are affected by rice spl mutations%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutant cells accumulated increased amounts of H(2)O(2) in response to rice blast fungal elicitor, These results suggest that the spl2, spl7 and spl11 mutants are defective in the regulation of NADPH oxidase, and the spl7 mutation may give rise to enhancement of the signaling pathway which protein dephosphorylation controls, while the spl2 mutation affects both the pathogen-induced and wound-induced signaling pathways
