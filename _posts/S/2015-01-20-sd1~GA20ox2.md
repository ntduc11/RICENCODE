## Expression information

## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function
2. __ ga __, [The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice SPINDLY gene functions as a negative regulator of gibberellin signaling by controlling the suppressive function of the DELLA protein, SLR1, and modulating brassinosteroid synthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The suppressive function of OsSPY in GA signaling was supported by the findings that the dwarfism was partially rescued and OsGA20ox2 (GA20 oxidase) expression was reduced in GA-deficient and GA-insensitive mutants by the knockdown of OsSPY function

4. __ ga __, [OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGSR1 is involved in crosstalk between gibberellins and brassinosteroids in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsGSR1 RNAi plants show a reduced sensitivity to GA treatment, an increased expression of the GA biosynthetic gene OsGA20ox2, which is feedback inhibited by GA signaling, and an elevated level of endogenous GA: together, these suggest that OsGSR1 is a positive regulator of GA signaling
5. __dwarf__, [A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role of OsGA20ox1 , encoding an isoform of gibberellin 20-oxidase, for regulation of plant stature in rice%5BTitle%5D)), ), OsGA20ox2 ( SD1 ), is well known as the Green Revolution gene, and loss-of function mutation in this locus causes semi-dwarfism
6. __gibberellin__, [Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The short stature of IR8 is due to a mutation in the plant's sd1 gene, and here we identify this gene as encoding an oxidase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellin, a plant growth hormone
7. __gibberellin__, [Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of dwarf 62, a loss-of-function mutation in DLT/OsGRAS-32 affecting gibberellin metabolism in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression levels of gibberellin (GA) biosynthetic genes including OsCPS1, OsKS1, OsKO1, OsKAO, OsGA20ox2/SD1 and OsGA2ox3 were significantly increased in d62 mutant

9. __growth__, [Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Green revolution: a mutant gibberellin-synthesis gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The short stature of IR8 is due to a mutation in the plant's sd1 gene, and here we identify this gene as encoding an oxidase enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellin, a plant growth hormone
10. __shoot__, [Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, overexpression of SLRL1 in normal rice plants induced a dwarf phenotype with an increased level of OsGA20ox2 gene expression and diminished the GA-induced shoot elongation, suggesting that SLRL1 acts as a repressor of GA signaling
