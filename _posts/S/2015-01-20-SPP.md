## Key message
1. __root__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
2. __chloroplast__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  Subcellular localization analysis indicates that SPP is targeted to the chloroplast, The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings, The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
3. __seedling__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of some genes associated with chloroplast development was decreased in young seedlings of the spp mutant, but not in 14-day-old seedlings, Western blot analysis revealed that the Rubisco small subunit is not precisely processed in the spp mutant in 7-day-old seedlings, but the processing activity in the spp mutant is restored in 14-day-old seedlings
4. __root development__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
5. __growth__, [A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice stromal processing peptidase regulates chloroplast and root development%5BTitle%5D)),  The present results reveal that SPP is essential for chloroplast biogenesis at the early growth stage and for rice root development; this is the first report on the function of SPP in monocot plants
