## Key message
1. __root__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
2. __dwarf__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study we analyzed a novel dwarf mutant, ssd1, of which phenotype is different from typical GA- or BR-related dwarf phenotype, Map-based cloning and complementation test demonstrated that the dwarf phenotype in ssd1 mutant was caused by insertion of retrotransposon in a gene, which encodes plant-specific protein with unknown biochemical function
3. __flower__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
4. __stem__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ssd1 exhibits pleiotropic defects in elongation of various organs such as stems, roots, leaves, and flowers
5. __cell division__, [SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ssd1 also shows abnormal cell files and shapes, which suggests defects of normal cell division in the mutant, Our results demonstrate that SSD1 controls plant elongation by controlling cell division in higher plants,SSD1, which encodes a plant-specific novel protein, controls plant elongation by regulating cell division in rice
