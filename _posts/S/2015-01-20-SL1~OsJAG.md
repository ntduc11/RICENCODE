## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase
2. __palea__, [STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
3. __lemma__, [STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels
4. __sterile__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
5. __lemma__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
6. __flower__, [STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4
7. __floral__, [STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development, Additionally, sl1 produces flowers with varied numbers of inner floral organs, and amorphous tissues without floral organ identity were frequently formed in whorls 3 and 4, The functional divergence between SL1 and JAG implies that SL1 was co-opted for its distinctive roles in specification of floral organ identity in rice after the lineage split from Arabidopsis
8. __palea__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
9. __reproductive__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase
10. __stamen__, [STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(STAMENLESS 1, encoding a single C2H2 zinc finger protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of the rice STAMENLESS 1 (SL1) gene that is involved in floral development, The sl1 mutant largely resembles the rice B-class gene mutant spw1; both exhibit homeotic conversions of lodicules and stamens to palea/lemma-like organs and carpels, We also show that SL1 specifies lodicule and stamen identities through positive transcriptional regulation of SPW1/OsMADS16 expression
11. __floral__, [Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, OsJAG does not affect the number of floral organ primordial and so of floral organs in each whorl, suggesting that OsJAG does not influence the initiation of floral organ primordia, but affect the developmental fate of all floral organs after their primordia have initiated, Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil
