## Key message
1. __growth__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To understand the underlying mechanism by which phyB regulates drought tolerance, we analyzed root growth and water loss from the leaves of phyB mutants, The root system showed no significant difference between the phyB mutants and WT, suggesting that improved drought tolerance has little relation to root growth
2. __flower__, [Distinct and cooperative functions of phytochromes A, B, and C in the control of deetiolation and flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Distinct and cooperative functions of phytochromes A, B, and C in the control of deetiolation and flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice is a short-day plant, and we found that mutation in either phyB or phyC caused moderate early flowering under the long-day photoperiod, while monogenic phyA mutation had little effect on the flowering time, The phyA mutation, however, in combination with phyB or phyC mutation caused dramatic early flowering
3. __ethylene__, [The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The multiple contributions of phytochromes to the control of internode elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A gene for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO1), which is an ethylene biosynthesis gene contributing to internode elongation, was up-regulated in phyAphyBphyC seedlings, In addition, the transcription levels of several ethylene- or gibberellin (GA)-related genes were changed in phyAphyBphyC mutants, and measurement of the plant hormone levels indicated low ethylene production and bioactive GA levels in the phyAphyBphyC mutants, We demonstrate that ethylene induced internode elongation and ACO1 expression in phyAphyBphyC seedlings but not in the wild type and that the presence of bioactive GAs was necessary for these effects
4. __heading date__, [Molecular dissection of the roles of phytochrome in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular dissection of the roles of phytochrome in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, phyB and phyA can affect Ghd7 activity and Early heading date1 (a floral inducer) activity in the network, respectively

20. __erect__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  phyB deficiency promoted the expression of both putative ERECTA family genes and EXPANSIN family genes involved in cell expansion in leaves, thus causing greater epidermal cell expansion in the phyB mutants

22. __leaf__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants, Reduced stomatal density resulted in reduced transpiration per unit leaf area in the phyB mutants, Considering all these findings, we propose that phyB deficiency causes both reduced total leaf area and reduced transpiration per unit leaf area, which explains the reduced water loss and improved drought tolerance of phyB mutants
23. __stomatal__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the developed leaves of phyB mutants displayed larger epidermal cells than WT leaves, resulting in reduced stomatal density, Reduced stomatal density resulted in reduced transpiration per unit leaf area in the phyB mutants
