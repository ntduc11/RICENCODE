## Key message
1. __lemma__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice
2. __palea__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice
3. __grain__, [An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An atypical bHLH protein encoded by POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 2 is involved in controlling grain length and weight of rice through interaction with a typical bHLH protein APG%5BTitle%5D)),  Previously, we have shown that an antagonistic pair of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1) and ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), is involved in controlling rice grain length, These findings suggest that PGL2 and PGL1 redundantly suppress the function of APG by forming heterodimers to positively regulate the rice grain length, while the pathway through which BU1, the closest homolog of PGL2, controls grain length is independent of APG
4. __grain length__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of an atypical bHLH, named POSITIVE REGULATOR OF GRAIN LENGTH 1 (PGL1), in lemma/palea increased grain length and weight in transgenic rice, PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1

4. __PGL1__, __SRS3~OsKINESIN-13A__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants
5. __APG~OsPIL16__, __PGL1__, [Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic actions of HLH/bHLH proteins are involved in grain length and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified the interaction partner of PGL1 and named it ANTAGONIST OF PGL1 (APG), PGL1 and APG interacted in vivo and localized in the nucleus, As expected, silencing of APG produced the same phenotype as overexpression of PGL1, suggesting antagonistic roles for the two genes, Transcription of two known grain-length-related genes, GS3 and SRS3, was largely unaffected in the PGL1-overexpressing and APG-silenced plants, PGL1-APG represents a new grain length and weight-controlling pathway in which APG is a negative regulator whose function is inhibited by PGL1
