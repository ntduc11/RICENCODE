## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis
2. __tapetum__, [The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis, These results, together with their mutant phenotypes, suggest that DTM1 plays important roles in the ER membrane during early tapetum development, functioning after MSP1 and before UDT1, and also in meiocyte development, after MEL1 and before PAIR1
3. __meiotic__, [The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  However, chromosomal fragmentation frequent in plant meiotic mutants was never observed in all of the pair1 meiocytes
4. __meiosis__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  CRC1 interacts with homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis1 (PAIR1) in vitro, suggesting that these proteins act as a complex to promote DSB formation
5. __flower__, [The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis
6. __anther__, [The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice gene DEFECTIVE TAPETUM AND MEIOCYTES 1 (DTM1) is required for early tapetum development and meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of UDT1, which functions in tapetum development during early meiosis, were reduced in dtm1 anthers, as were those of PAIR1, which is involved in chromosome pairing and synapsis during meiosis, Moreover, transcripts of DTM1 were reduced in msp1 mutant anthers, but not in udt1 and pair1 mutants
7. __meiosis__, [The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)), We have identified and characterized a novel gene, PAIR1 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1), required for homologous chromosome pairing and cytokinesis in male and female meiocytes of rice (Oryza sativa), The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis-specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes, Expression of the PAIR1 gene was detected in the early stages of flower development, in which the majority of the sporocytes had not entered meiosis, These observations clarify that the PAIR1 protein plays an essential role in establishment of homologous chromosome pairing in rice meiosis
8. __sterility__, [The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The novel gene HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS1 of rice encodes a putative coiled-coil protein required for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  The pair1 mutation, tagged by the endogenous retrotransposon Tos17, exhibited meiosis-specific defects and resulted in complete sterility in male and female gametes
