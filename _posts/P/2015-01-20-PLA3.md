## Key message
1. __seed__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
2. __homeostasis__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with these pleiotropic phenotypes, PLA3 is expressed in the whole plant body, and is involved in plant hormone homeostasis
3. __leaf__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the identification of the rice gene PLASTOCHRON3 (PLA3)/GOLIATH (GO) that regulates various developmental processes including the rate of leaf initiation (the plastochron), pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase, However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology
4. __shoot__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase
5. __reproductive__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase

## Connection
1. __PLA2~LHD2__, __PLA3__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase, However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology, Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly
2. __PLA1__, __PLA3__, [PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON3/GOLIATH encodes a glutamate carboxypeptidase required for proper development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pla3 exhibits similar phenotypes to pla1 and pla2- a shortened plastochron, precocious leaf maturation and rachis branch-to-shoot conversion in the reproductive phase, However, in contrast to pla1 and pla2, pla3 showed pleiotropic phenotypes including enlarged embryo, seed vivipary, defects in SAM maintenance and aberrant leaf morphology, Double mutant analysis revealed that PLA1, PLA2 and PLA3 are regulated independently but function redundantly
