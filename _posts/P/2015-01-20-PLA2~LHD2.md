17. __leaf__, [PLASTOCHRON2 Regulates Leaf Initiation and Maturation in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PLASTOCHRON2 Regulates Leaf Initiation and Maturation in Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  PLA2 is expressed predominantly in young leaf primordia, We show that PLA2 normally acts to retard the rate of leaf maturation but does so independently of PLA1, which encodes a member of the P450 family
