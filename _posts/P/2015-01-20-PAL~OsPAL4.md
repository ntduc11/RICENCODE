## Key message
1. __sheath__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
2. __sheath__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast
3. __disease__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)), Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.

6. __blast__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  The heterozygous ospal4 mutant line exhibited increased susceptibility to three distinct rice diseases, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and rice blast
7. __blast__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAL6 co-localizes with a QTL for rice blast resistance, and is down-regulated in the ospal4 mutant line; this may explain enhanced susceptibility to Magnoporthe oryzae
8. __blight__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
9. __breeding__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  Overall, these results suggest that OsPAL4 and possibly OsPAL6 are key contributors to resistance governed by QTL and are potential breeding targets for improved broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice
10. __resistance__, [Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene OsPAL4 is associated with broad spectrum disease resistance.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPAL4 clusters with three additional OsPAL genes that co-localize with QTL for bacterial blight and sheath blight disease resistance on rice chromosome 2
