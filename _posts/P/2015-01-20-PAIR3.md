## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal
2. __meiosis__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in rice, PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis, Our results suggest that PAIR3 plays a crucial role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in meiosis,Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis
3. __sterility__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Two independent alleles, designated pair3-1 and pair3-2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes
4. __pollen__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
5. __reproductive__, [Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of the rice gene PAIR3 results in lack of bivalent formation in meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  PAIR3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis
