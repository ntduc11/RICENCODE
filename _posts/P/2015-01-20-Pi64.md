## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene
2. __leaf__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars
3. __resistance__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Only transformants with NBS-2 conferred resistance to leaf and neck blast, validating the idea that NBS-2 represents the functional Pi64 gene

5. __development__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Pi64 is constitutively expressed at all development stages and in all tissues examined
6. __blast__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars
7. __breeding__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars
8. __cytoplasm__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus
9. __nucleus__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Pi64 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus
10. __blast resistance__, [Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Pi64, Encoding a Novel CC-NBS-LRR Protein, Confers Resistance to Leaf and Neck Blast in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, introgression of Pi64 into susceptible cultivars via gene transformation and marker-assisted selection conferred high-level and broad-spectrum leaf and neck blast resistance to indica-sourced isolates, demonstrating its potential utility in breeding BSR rice cultivars
