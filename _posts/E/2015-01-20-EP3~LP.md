## Key message
1. __erect__, [Map-based cloning of the ERECT PANICLE 3 gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Map-based cloning of the ERECT PANICLE 3 gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic analysis revealed that the erect panicle phenotype was controlled by a single recessive mutation designated erect panicle 3 (ep3), A line carrying a T-DNA insertion in LOC_ Os02g15950 was obtained and shown to have the same phenotype as the ep3 mutant, thus confirming the identification of LOC_Os02g15950 as the ERECT PANICLE 3 (EP3) gene, The ep3 mutation causes a significant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype
2. __vascular bundle__, [Map-based cloning of the ERECT PANICLE 3 gene in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Map-based cloning of the ERECT PANICLE 3 gene in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The ep3 mutation causes a significant increase in the number of small vascular bundles as well as the thickness of parenchyma in the peduncle, which results in the erect panicle phenotype
3. __architecture__, [Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture, These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants
4. __panicle size__, [Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture
5. __panicle architecture__, [Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants

7. __panicle__, [Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We report herein an in-depth characterization of two allelic larger panicle (lp) mutants that show significantly increased panicle size as well as improved plant architecture, Map-based cloning reveals that LARGER PANICLE (LP) encodes a Kelch repeat-containing F-box protein, These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants
8. __grain__, [Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations in the F-box gene LARGER PANICLE improve the panicle architecture and enhance the grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that LP plays an important role in regulating plant architecture, particularly in regulating panicle architecture, thereby representing promising targets for genetic improvement of grain production plants
