## Key message
1. __defense response__, ["EL5, a rice N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor-responsive RING-H2 finger protein, is a ubiquitin ligase which functions in vitro in co-operation with an elicitor-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, OsUBC5b"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("EL5, a rice N-acetylchitooligosaccharide elicitor-responsive RING-H2 finger protein, is a ubiquitin ligase which functions in vitro in co-operation with an elicitor-responsive ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, OsUBC5b"%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that EL5 and OsUBC5b have roles in plant defense response through the turnover of protein(s) via the ubiquitin/proteasome system
2. __cell death__, [RING-H2 type ubiquitin ligase EL5 is involved in root development through the maintenance of cell viability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RING-H2 type ubiquitin ligase EL5 is involved in root development through the maintenance of cell viability in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants expressing EL5C153A and EL5W165A, which encode an inactive E3, showed a rootless phenotype accompanied by cell death in root primordia, and those expressing EL5V162A, with moderately impaired E3 activity, formed short crown roots with necrotic lateral roots
