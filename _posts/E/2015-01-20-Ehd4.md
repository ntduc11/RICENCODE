## Key message
1. __flower__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ehd4 mutants showed a never flowering phenotype under natural long-day conditions, We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice,Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice
2. __flowering time__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice
3. __heading date__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4)

## Connection
1. __Ehd4__, __Hd3a__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
2. __Ehd4__, __RFT1__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators
3. __Ehd1__, __Ehd4__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4), Ehd4 expression is most active in young leaves with a diurnal expression pattern similar to that of Ehd1 under both short-day and long-day conditions, We show that Ehd4 up-regulates the expression of the "florigen" genes Hd3a and RFT1 through Ehd1, but it acts independently of other known Ehd1 regulators, We conclude that Ehd4 is a novel Oryza-genus-specific regulator of Ehd1, and it plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice
