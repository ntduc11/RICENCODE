## Expression information

## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcript levels of three flowering regulators-Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a-were decreased in these mutants, whereas those of OsGI and Hd1 were unchanged, These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a, To further investigate the relationship with other flowering promoters, we generated transgenic plants in which expression of Ehd1 or OsGI was suppressed, In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1,OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a
2. __height__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
3. __grain__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
4. __flower__, [OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically in regulating long day (LD)-dependent flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These observations imply that OsMADS50 and OsMADS56 function antagonistically through OsLFL1-Ehd1 in regulating LD-dependent flowering
5. __flower__, [Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)), Heading date gene, dth3 controlled late flowering in O. Glaberrima Steud. by down-regulating Ehd1
6. __flower__, [Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results provide direct evidence that phytochromes inhibit flowering by affecting both Hd1 and Ehd1 flowering pathways
7. __heading date__, [Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of PHOTOPERIOD SENSITIVITY5 sheds light on the role of phytochromes in photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Early heading date1 (Ehd1), an additional rice floral activator, was also highly expressed in the s73 mutant, suggesting that SE5 represses Ehd1 in wild-type plants
8. __flower__, [Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  Since the two genes Se1 (= Hd1) and Ef1 (= Ehd1) are known to up-regulate the rice homolog of Arabidopsis FT, it is suggested that the detected epistasis may respond to diverse environments by modulating the CO/FT system conserved in flowering plants
9. __flower__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice, Among these regulators, Ehd1, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions
10. __leaf__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf
11. __shoot__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development
12. __flower__, [OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB%5BTitle%5D)), OsCOL4 is a constitutive flowering repressor upstream of Ehd1 and downstream of OsphyB
13. __panicle__, [Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Flowering time genes Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1 together control panicle development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The results revealed that the combination of Heading-date 1 (Hd1) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) can reduce the number of primary branches in a panicle, resulting in smaller spikelet numbers per panicle; this occurs independently of the control of flowering time, We further revealed that Hd1 and/or Ehd1 caused up-regulation of Terminal Flower 1-like genes and precocious expression of panicle formation-related genes at shoot apical meristems during panicle development, Therefore, two key flowering time genes, Hd1 and Ehd1, can control panicle development in rice; this may affect crop yields in the field through florigen expression in leaf
14. __flower__, [A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A major QTL, Ghd8, plays pleiotropic roles in regulating grain productivity, plant height, and heading date in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  By regulating Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a, Ghd8 delayed flowering under long-day conditions, but promoted flowering under short-day conditions
15. __heading date__, [Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Epistasis among the three major flowering time genes in rice: coordinate changes of photoperiod sensitivity, basic vegetative growth and optimum photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  The comparison of the nucleotide sequences suggested that Ef1 is the same as Early heading date 1 (Ehd1)
16. __floral__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction
17. __heading date__, [Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice
18. __heading date__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome)
19. __heading date__, [DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously%5BTitle%5D)),  The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions
20. __floral__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Among these regulators, Ehd1, a rice-specific floral inducer, integrates multiple pathways to regulate RFT1, leading to flowering under appropriate photoperiod conditions
21. __grain number__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
22. __flower__, [Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsLFL1 in rice represses Ehd1 by binding on its promoter%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, it was found that the flowering promoting gene Ehd1 and its putative downstream genes were all repressed by OsLFL1

24. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Under SD conditions, flowering is promoted through the activation of FT-like genes (rice florigens) by Heading date 1 (Hd1, a rice CONSTANS homolog) and Early heading date 1 (Ehd1, with no ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome), On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice, Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1
25. __floral__, [LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LHD1, an allele of DTH8/Ghd8, controls late heading date in common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)%5BTitle%5D)),  We also found that LHD1 could down-regulate the expression of several floral transition activators such as Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under long-day conditions, but not under short-day conditions
26. __flower__, [Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Indeterminate 1 (OsId1) is necessary for the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) regardless of photoperiod%5BTitle%5D)),  OsId1 regulates the expression of Ehd1 (Early heading date 1) and its downstream genes, including Hd3a (a rice ortholog of FT) and RFT1 (Rice Flowering Locus T1), under both SD and LD conditions, In rice, the expression of Ehd1 is also controlled by the photoperiodic flowering genes OsGI (a rice ortholog of GI) and OsMADS51, This study demonstrates that the activation of Ehd1 by OsId1 is required for the promotion of flowering
27. __heading date__, [OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, OsELF3-1 is involved in blue light signaling by activating early heading date 1 (Ehd1) expression to promote rice flowering under short-day (SD) conditions
28. __heading date__, [Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd4 encodes a novel and Oryza-genus-specific regulator of photoperiodic flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report isolation and characterization of a positive regulator of Ehd1, Early heading date 4 (Ehd4)
29. __flower__, [DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously%5BTitle%5D)),  The quantitative real-time PCR assay revealed that DTH8 could down-regulate the transcriptions of Ehd1 (for Early heading date1) and Hd3a (for Heading date3a; a rice ortholog of FLOWERING LOCUS T) under long-day conditions, Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS)

31. __flower__, [Ehd1, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd1, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that the rice Early heading date 1 (Ehd1) gene, which confers SD promotion of flowering in the absence of a functional allele of Hd1, encodes a B-type response regulator that might not have an ortholog in the Arabidopsis genome, Ehd1 mRNA was induced by 1-wk SD treatment, and Ehd1 may promote flowering by inducing FT-like gene expression only under SD conditions,Ehd1, a B-type response regulator in rice, confers short-day promotion of flowering and controls FT-like gene expression independently of Hd1
32. __flower__, [OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression

34. __flower__, [Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1%5BTitle%5D)),  To assign the position of Ehd2 within the flowering pathway of rice, we compared transcript levels of previously isolated flowering-time genes, such as Ehd1, a member of the unique pathway, Hd3a, and Rice FT-like1 (RFT1; rice florigens), between the wild-type plants and the ehd2 mutants, Severely reduced expression of these genes in ehd2 under both short- and long-day conditions suggests that Ehd2 acts as a flowering promoter mainly by up-regulating Ehd1 and by up-regulating the downstream Hd3a and RFT1 genes in the unique genetic network of photoperiodic flowering in rice,Ehd2, a rice ortholog of the maize INDETERMINATE1 gene, promotes flowering by up-regulating Ehd1

80. __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(%5BTitle%5D)), SDG711 was also found to be involved in the repression of Ehd1 in LD.
81. __Ehd1__, __OsCLF~SDG711__, [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(%5BTitle%5D)), SDG711 was shown to directly target to OsLF and Ehd1 loci to mediate H3K27me3 and gene repression.
82. __Ehd1__, __Ghd7.1~Hd2~OsPRR37~DTH7__, [Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
83. __Ehd1__, __OsCCT01__, [Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions
84. __Ehd1__, __MRG702__, [MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MRG702, a reader protein of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, is involved in brassinosteroid-regulated growth and flowering time control in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene transcription analyses showed that MRG702 knock-down resulted in the down-regulation of BR-related genes, including D11, BRI1, and BU1, and several flowering genes including Ehd1, Ehd2/OsID1/RID1, Ehd3,OsMADS50, Hd3a, and RFT1
85. __Ehd1__, __FKF1~OsFKF1__, [Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcriptional analysis revealed that OsFKF1 up-regulates expression of the floral activator Ehd2 and down-regulates expression of the floral repressor Ghd7; these regulators up- and down-regulate Ehd1 expression, respectively
86. __Ehd1__, __FKF1~OsFKF1__, [Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsFKF1 can upregulate Ehd1 expression under blue light treatment, without affecting the expression of Ehd2 and Ghd7
87. __Ehd1__, __FKF1~OsFKF1__, [Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX 1 (OsFKF1) promotes flowering independent of photoperiod.%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the LD-specific floral activator Arabidopsis FKF1, OsFKF1 likely acts as an autonomous floral activator because it promotes flowering independent of photoperiod, probably via its distinct roles in controlling expression of rice-specific genes including Ehd2, Ghd7, and Ehd1
