## Key message
1. __panicle__, [The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The effective panicles and seed-setting rate were reduced in the ETR2-overexpressing plants, while thousand-seed weight was substantially enhanced in both the ETR2-RNAi plants and the etr2 mutant compared with controls
2. __ethylene__, [The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we characterized a subfamily II ethylene receptor, ETHYLENE RESPONSE2 (ETR2), in rice (Oryza sativa), Overexpression of ETR2 in transgenic rice plants reduced ethylene sensitivity and delayed floral transition, Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T-DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering,The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice

4. __flower__, [The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ethylene receptor ETR2 delays floral transition and affects starch accumulation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) plants exhibited early flowering and the ETR2 T-DNA insertion mutant etr2 showed enhanced ethylene sensitivity and early flowering, The GIGANTEA and TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS homolog (RCN1) that cause delayed flowering were upregulated in ETR2-overexpressing plants but downregulated in the etr2 mutant, Thus, ETR2 may delay flowering and cause starch accumulation in stems by regulating downstream genes
