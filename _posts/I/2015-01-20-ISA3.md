## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
2. __endosperm__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm, ISA3-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein expressed under the control of the rice ISA3 promoter was targeted to the amyloplast stroma in the endosperm, Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules
3. __starch__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night, We investigated whether ISA3 plays a role in amyloplast development and starch metabolism in the developing endosperm, Overexpression of ISA3 in the sugary1 mutant, which is deficient in ISA1 activity, did not convert water-soluble phytoglycogen to starch granules, indicating that ISA1 and ISA3 are not functionally redundant, Both overexpression and loss of function of ISA3 in the endosperm generated pleomorphic amyloplasts and starch granules, These results suggest that ISA3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects morphological characteristics of plastids in rice
4. __leaf__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  A transposon-inserted rice mutant of isoamylase3 (isa3) contained an increased amount of starch in the leaf blade at the end of the night, indicating that ISA3 plays a role in the degradation of transitory starch during the night, Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
5. __seedling__, [Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice debranching enzyme isoamylase3 facilitates starch metabolism and affects plastid morphogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, chloroplasts in the leaf blade of isa3 seedlings were large and pleomorphic
