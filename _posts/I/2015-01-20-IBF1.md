## Publication
1. [A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows%5BTitle%5D)), 2012, Theor Appl Genet.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __reproductive__, [A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time RT-PCR and GUS activity assays revealed that IBF1 specifically expressed in reproductive tissues
2. __seed__, [A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel gene IBF1 is required for the inhibition of brown pigment deposition in rice hull furrows%5BTitle%5D)),  In the ibf1 mutant, brown pigments specifically accumulate in hull furrows during seed maturation and reach a maximum level in dry seeds
