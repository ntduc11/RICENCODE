## Publication
1. [OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant Sci.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes  
__OverExpression__: In this study we found that the rice Aux/IAA gene OsIAA6 is highly induced by drought stress and that its overexpression in transgenic rice improved drought tolerance, likely via the regulation of auxin biosynthesis genes  
__RNAi__:
