## Expression information
__Expression__: This indicates that OsWRKY6 can directly regulate OsICS1 expression and thereby increase SA concentrations |  Our results suggest that OsWRKY6 positively regulates defense responses through activation of OsICS1 expression and OsWRKY6 stabilization  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
