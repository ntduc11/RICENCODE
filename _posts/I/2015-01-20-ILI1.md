## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending, ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis
2. __ BR __, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified a rice mutant (ili1-D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that caused by BR treatment, BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1
3. __transcription factor__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, ILI1 and PRE1 may inactivate inhibitory bHLH transcription factors through heterodimerization, BR increases the RNA levels of ILI1 and PRE1 but represses IBH1 through the transcription factor BZR1
4. __lamina__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified a rice mutant (ili1-D) showing an increased lamina inclination phenotype similar to that caused by BR treatment, Overexpression and RNA interference suppression of ILI1 increase and reduce, respectively, rice laminar inclination, confirming a positive role of ILI1 in leaf bending, The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest
5. __leaf__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1
6. __cell elongation__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis
7. __erect__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis
8. __growth__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  The spatial and temporal expression patterns support roles of ILI1 in laminar joint bending and PRE1/At IBH1 in the transition from growth of young organs to growth arrest
9. __dwarf__, [Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Antagonistic HLH/bHLH transcription factors mediate brassinosteroid regulation of cell elongation and plant development in rice and Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  ILI1 and PRE1 interact with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein IBH1 (ILI1 binding bHLH), whose overexpression causes erect leaf in rice and dwarfism in Arabidopsis, Overexpression of ILI1 or PRE1 increases cell elongation and suppresses dwarf phenotypes caused by overexpression of IBH1 in Arabidopsis
