## Key message
1. __stamen__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we screened 4416 lab-created T(1) rice T-DNA tagged lines and identified a mutant, designated dh1 (degenerated hull1), with phenotype of degenerated hull and naked pistils and stamens
2. __floral__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
3. __culm__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
4. __palea__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma
5. __lemma__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma
6. __leaf__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
7. __root__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
8. __panicle__, [DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DH1, a LOB domain-like protein required for glume formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Approximately 60% florets on the dh1 panicle defected in forming normal palea and lemma, The result of transformation by a fused expression vector, pDH1::GFP, revealed that DH1 had the keen spatial and temporal characteristics of expressing at axillary bud, young panicle and floral organs but not at root, leaf, node and culm, and strongly expressing at young tissues but weakly at mature organs
