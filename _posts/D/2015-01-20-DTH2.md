## Expression information

## Key message
1. __domestication__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding
2. __flower__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
3. __reproductive__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, association analysis and transgenic experiments identified two functional nucleotide polymorphisms in DTH2 that correlated with early heading and increased reproductive fitness under natural LD conditions in northern Asia
4. __floral__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
5. __heading date__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that DTH2 encodes a CONSTANS-like protein that promotes heading by inducing the florigen genes Heading date 3a and RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1, and it acts independently of the known floral integrators Heading date 1 and Early heading date 1
6. __breeding__, [Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Association of functional nucleotide polymorphisms at DTH2 with the northward expansion of rice cultivation in Asia%5BTitle%5D)),  Our combined population genetics and network analyses suggest that DTH2 likely represents a target of human selection for adaptation to LD conditions during rice domestication and/or improvement, demonstrating an important role of minor-effect quantitative trait loci in crop adaptation and breeding
