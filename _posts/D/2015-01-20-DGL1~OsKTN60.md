## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR, In addition to the dwarf phenotype, dgl1 produces leaves with abnormally rounded tip regions
2. __ ga __, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR, GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced, The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant, Instead, aberrant microtubule organization caused by the loss of the microtubule-severing function of DGL1 may result in enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in that enhanced expression was also observed in a BR-deficient mutant with aberrant microtubule organization
3. __growth__, [Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
4. __root__, [Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
5. __cell elongation__, [Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsKTN80a, a katanin P80 ortholog, caused the repressed cell elongation and stalled cell division mediated by microtubule apparatus defects in primary root in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  We prove that OsKTN80a, possibly associated with OsKTN60, is involved in root growth via regulating the cell elongation and division
6. __gibberellin__, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the function of DGL1 is important for cell and organ elongation in rice, and aberrant DGL1-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling
7. __ BR __, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  GA biosynthetic genes are up-regulated in dgl1, but the expression of BR biosynthetic genes is not enhanced
8. __leaf__, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report a rice (Oryza sativa) dwarf mutant, dwarf and gladius leaf 1 (dgl1), which exhibits only minimal response to GA and BR
