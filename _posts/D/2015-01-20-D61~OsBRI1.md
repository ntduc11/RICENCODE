11. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsBISERK1~OsSERK1~OsBAK1__, [OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D)), In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
12. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsARF19__, [The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.%5BTitle%5D)), The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.
13. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsARF19__, [The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.%5BTitle%5D)),  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression
14. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsDof12~OsCDF1__, [Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsDof12 affects plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Of note, in WT plants the expression of OsDof12 was found up-regulated by BR treatment while in OsDof12 overexpression plants two positive BR signaling regulators, OsBRI1 and OsBZR1, were significantly down-regulated, indicating that OsDof12 may act as a negative BR regulator in rice
