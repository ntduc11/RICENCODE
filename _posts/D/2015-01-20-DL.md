9. __palea__, [The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The DROOPING LEAF and OsETTIN2 genes promote awn development in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The awn is a long needle-like appendage that, in some grass species, is formed on the lemma that encloses floral organs together with the palea
