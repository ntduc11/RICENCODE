## Information
__Symbol__: D14L  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os03g32270](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g32270)  
__RAPdb__: [Os03g0437600](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os03g0437600)  

## Publication
1. [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, J Genet Genomics.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: The mesocotyls of D14L RNAi lines are longer than those of WT in the dark |  This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation  

## Key message
1. __vascular bundle__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia
2. __root__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia
3. __crown__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia
4. __crown root__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  D14L mRNA is predominantly expressed in vascular bundles and crown root primordia

## Connection
1. __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we examined the function of another D14 family gene in rice, D14 LIKE (D14L), focusing on mesocotyl growth
2. __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  This phenotype is enhanced when the D14L RNAi lines are combined with the d14 mutation, suggesting that D14 and D14L work independently to inhibit mesocotyl elongation
3. __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
