1. __strigolactone__, [D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D)), D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling
2. __growth__, [D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D)),  We demonstrate that, in a D14- and D3-dependent manner, SLs induce D53 degradation by the proteasome and abrogate its activity in promoting axillary bud outgrowth
3. __dwarf__, [DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the characterization of a dominant SL-insensitive rice (Oryza sativa) mutant dwarf 53 (d53) and the cloning of D53, which encodes a substrate of the SCF(D3) ubiquitination complex and functions as a repressor of SL signalling
4. __dwarf__, [D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that DWARF 53 (D53) acts as a repressor of SL signalling and that SLs induce its degradation, The D53 gene product shares predicted features with the class I Clp ATPase proteins and can form a complex with the alpha/beta hydrolase protein DWARF 14 (D14) and the F-box protein DWARF 3 (D3), two previously identified signalling components potentially responsible for SL perception
5. __tiller__, [D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(D14-SCF(D3)-dependent degradation of D53 regulates strigolactone signalling%5BTitle%5D)),  We find that the rice (Oryza sativa) d53 mutant, which produces an exaggerated number of tillers compared to wild-type plants, is caused by a gain-of-function mutation and is insensitive to exogenous SL treatment
6. __resistant__, [DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DWARF 53 acts as a repressor of strigolactone signalling in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Treatments with GR24, a synthetic SL analogue, cause D53 degradation via the proteasome in a manner that requires D14 and the SCF(D3) ubiquitin ligase, whereas the dominant form of D53 is resistant to SL-mediated degradation"
