## Key message
1. __ BR __, [A comprehensive genetic study reveals a crucial role of CYP90D2/D2 in regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A comprehensive genetic study reveals a crucial role of CYP90D2/D2 in regulating plant architecture in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Our chemical analysis suggested that CYP90D2/D2 might catalyze C-3 dehydrogenation step in BR biosynthesis
2. __ BR __, [A rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), is caused by a loss of function of a new member of cytochrome P450](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, ebisu dwarf (d2), is caused by a loss of function of a new member of cytochrome P450%5BTitle%5D)),  The accumulation profile of BR intermediates in the d2 mutants confirmed that these plants are deficient in late BR biosynthesis, The D2 gene encoded a novel cytochrome P450 classified in CYP90D that is highly similar to the reported BR synthesis enzymes, Based on these results, we conclude that D2/CYP90D2 catalyzes the steps from 6-deoxoteasterone to 3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone and from teasterone to 3-dehydroteasterone in the late BR biosynthesis pathway

6. __insect__, [Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of brassinosteroids in vitro%5BTitle%5D)),  However, in vitro biochemical assays using baculovirus/insect cell-produced proteins revealed that both CYP90D2 and CYP90D3 catalyze C-23 hydroxylation of various 22-hydroxylated brassinosteroids, but with markedly different catalytic efficiencies
