2. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, two Dmc1 genes, Dmc1A and Dmc1B, have been reported
3. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein has been partially characterized, however the biochemical properties of the DMC1B protein have not been defined
4. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  In the present study, we expressed the Oryza sativa DMC1A and DMC1B proteins in bacteria and purified them
5. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  The purified DMC1A and DMC1B proteins formed helical filaments along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and promoted robust strand exchange between ssDNA and dsDNA over five thousand base pairs in the presence of RPA, as a co-factor
6. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  The DMC1A and DMC1B proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of RPA with long DNA substrates containing several thousand base pairs
7. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  The strand-exchange activity of the Oryza sativa DMC1A protein was much higher than that of the DMC1B protein
8. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistently, the DNA-binding activity of the DMC1A protein was higher than that of the DMC1B protein
9. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __DMC1B__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins.%5BTitle%5D)),  These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice
