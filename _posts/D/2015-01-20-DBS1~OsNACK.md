## Key message
1. __root__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
2. __growth__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal, These observations suggest that DBS1 is involved in the growth and development of organs but not in organ initiation or organogenesis
3. __dwarf__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1)
4. __shoot__, [The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice mutant dwarf bamboo shoot 1: a leaky mutant of the NACK-type kinesin-like gene can initiate organ primordia but not organ development%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report on one of the most severe dwarf mutants of rice, dwarf bamboo shoot 1 (dbs1), Relative to the severe defects in shoot and root growth, the overall structure of the dbs1 embryo was almost normal
