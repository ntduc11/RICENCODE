## Key message
1. __cytokinin__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis showed that several type-A response regulator genes that act in the cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway were downregulated in the dec mutant,Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway
2. __meristem__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
3. __seedling__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, dec seedlings showed a reduced responsiveness to exogenous CK
4. __root__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
5. __root apical meristem__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
6. __cell division__, [Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DECUSSATE controls phyllotaxy by affecting the cytokinin signaling pathway%5BTitle%5D)),  The dec mutants had an enlarged SAM with enhanced cell division activity, In contrast to the SAM, the size of the root apical meristem (RAM) in dec was reduced, and cell division activity was suppressed
