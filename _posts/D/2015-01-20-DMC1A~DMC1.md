## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Filament formation and robust strand exchange activities of the rice DMC1A and DMC1B proteins%5BTitle%5D)),  These biochemical differences between the DMC1A and DMC1B proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during meiosis in rice

## Connection
1. __DMC1A~DMC1__, __XRCC3__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
