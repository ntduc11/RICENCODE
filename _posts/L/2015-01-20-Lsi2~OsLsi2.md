1. __root__, [Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots
2. __transporter__, [Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transporters of arsenite in rice and their role in arsenic accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, in the rice mutants defective in the silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, arsenite transport to the xylem and accumulation in shoots and grain decreased greatly
3. __arsenite__, [The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice aquaporin Lsi1 mediates uptake of methylated arsenic species%5BTitle%5D)),  Recent studies have shown that arsenite is taken up by rice (Oryza sativa) roots through two silicon transporters, Lsi1 (the aquaporin NIP2;1) and Lsi2 (an efflux carrier)
4. __transporter__, [Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of two Si transporter genes (Low silicon rice 1 [Lsi1] and Lsi2) investigated using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed higher expression of both genes in Nipponbare than in Kasalath, Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots
