## Key message
1. __panicle__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms, The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
2. __spikelet__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27
3. __culm__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
4. __yield__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops,Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components
5. __gibberellin__, [Overexpression of rice LRK1 restricts internode elongation by down-regulating OsKO2](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of rice LRK1 restricts internode elongation by down-regulating OsKO2%5BTitle%5D)),  Analyses of gene expression demonstrated that LRK1 restricts gibberellin biosynthesis during the internode elongation process by down-regulation of the gibberellin biosynthetic gene coding for ent-kaurene oxidase
6. __root__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data showed that rice LRK1 is a plasma membrane protein expressed constitutively in leaves, young panicles, roots and culms
7. __cellular proliferation__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  The over-expression of rice LRK1 results in increased panicles, spikelets per panicle, weight per grain and enhanced cellular proliferation, leading to a 27, Our data suggest that rice LRK1 regulates rice branch number by enhancing cellular proliferation
8. __grain yield__, [Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of the rice LRK1 gene improves quantitative yield components%5BTitle%5D)),  The functional characterization of rice LRK1 facilitates an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cereal crop yield, and may have utility in improving grain yield in cereal crops
