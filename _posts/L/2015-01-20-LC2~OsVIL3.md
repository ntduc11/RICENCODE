## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
2. __brassinosteroid__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
3. __vernalization__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  The LC2 gene was isolated through positional cloning, and encodes a vernalization insensitive 3-like protein
4. __phytohormone__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
5. __flower__, [LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we demonstrated that rice LC2 (OsVIL3) and OsVIL2 (two OsVILs, possible components of PRC2 complex) promote rice flowering
6. __floral__, [LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, LC2 binds to the promoter region of a floral repressor OsLF and represses the OsLF expression via H3K27 tri-methylation modification
7. __auxin__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids

9. __leaf__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  To understand the molecular mechanism controlling rice leaf angles, one rice leaf inclination2 (lc2, three alleles) mutant was identified and functionally characterized, Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint, Complementary expression of LC2 reversed the enlarged leaf angles of lc2 plants, confirming its role in controlling leaf inclination, LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids, LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects
10. __cell division__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint, LC2 is localized in the nucleus and defects of LC2 result in altered expression of cell division and hormone-responsive genes, indicating an important role of LC2 in regulating leaf inclination and mediating hormone effects

12. __lamina__, [Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice leaf inclination2, a VIN3-like protein, regulates leaf angle through modulating cell division of the collar%5BTitle%5D)),  Compared to wild-type plants, lc2 mutants have enlarged leaf angles due to increased cell division in the adaxial epidermis of lamina joint, LC2 is mainly expressed in the lamina joint during leaf development, and particularly, is induced by the phytohormones abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, auxin, and brassinosteroids
