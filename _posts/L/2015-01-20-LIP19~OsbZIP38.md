## Expression information

## Key message
1. __temperature__, [Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-temperature-dependent expression of a rice gene encoding a protein with a leucine-zipper motif%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of lip19 is positively regulated by low temperature, but not affected by high (40 degrees C) temperature, The possibility is suggested that Lip19 is a transcriptional factor that is positively controlled by low temperature"
2. __temperature__, ["LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants"%5BTitle%5D)), "The rice low-temperature-induced lip19 gene encodes a 148-amino-acid basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein, termed LIP19, Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical, Based upon the presented data, we propose a model describing the low-temperature signal switching mediated by LIP19 in rice"

## Connection
1. __LIP19~OsbZIP38__, __OsOBF1~OsbZIP87__, [LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LIP19, a basic region leucine zipper protein, is a Fos-like molecular switch in the cold signaling of rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The protein-protein interaction in homo- and hetero-combinations between LIP19 and OsOBF1 was confirmed in vitro and in planta, LIP19 and OsOBF1 most likely interact with each other more strongly than OsOBF1 interacts with itself, and the resulting heterodimer binds to the C/G hybrid sequence but not to the hexamer sequence, Whereas the expression patterns of lip19 and OsOBF1 in response to low temperatures were totally opposite, the locations of their expression were almost identical
