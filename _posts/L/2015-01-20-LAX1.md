## Connection
1. __Gnp4~LAX2__, __LAX1__, [LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems%5BTitle%5D)),  The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage, The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching, LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1, We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation
2. __LAX1__, __RFL~APO2__, [Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that RFL promotes AM specification through its effects on LAX1 and CUC genes, as their expression was modulated on RFL knockdown, on induction of RFL:GR fusion protein, and by a repressive RFL-EAR fusion protein
3. __LAX1__, __RFL~APO2__, [Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, we have found that RFL regulates the LAX1 and CUC genes during AM specification, and positively influences the outgrowth of AMs though its effects on auxin transport
