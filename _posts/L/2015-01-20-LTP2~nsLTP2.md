## Key message
1. __seed__, [Characterization of a gene encoding an abscisic acid-inducible type-2 lipid transfer protein from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a gene encoding an abscisic acid-inducible type-2 lipid transfer protein from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ltp2 mRNA is accumulated only in mature seeds
2. __defense__, [Solution structure of plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-2 from rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Solution structure of plant nonspecific lipid transfer protein-2 from rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The positively charged residues on the molecular surface of nsLTP2 are structurally similar to other plant defense proteins

## Connection
1. __LTP2~nsLTP2__, __OsC6__, [OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsC6, encoding a lipid transfer protein, is required for postmeiotic anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Found in monocots, OsC6 belongs to a distinct clade from previously identified LTP1 and LTP2 family members found in both dicots and monocots
