1. __domestication__, [LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LABA1, a Domestication Gene Associated with Long, Barbed Awns in Wild Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Haplotype analysis revealed that the laba1 allele originated in the japonica subspecies and moved into the indica gene pool via introgression, suggesting that humans selected for this locus in early rice domestication
