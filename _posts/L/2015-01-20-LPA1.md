## Key message
1. __tiller__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint
2. __tiller angle__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint
3. __ethylene__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 is localized in the nucleus and functions as an active transcriptional repressor, an activity mainly conferred by a conserved ethylene response factor-associated amphiphilic repression-like motif
4. __sheath__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint
5. __leaf__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint, Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint
6. __growth__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint
7. __lamina__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LPA1 regulates tiller angle and leaf angle by controlling the adaxial growth of tiller node and lamina joint, Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint
8. __shoot__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), LPA1 was also found to affect shoot gravitropism
9. __architecture__, [Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Loose Plant Architecture1, an INDETERMINATE DOMAIN protein involved in shoot gravitropism, regulates plant architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the cloning and characterization of the Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) gene in rice, the functional ortholog of the AtIDD15/SHOOT GRAVITROPISM5 (SGR5) gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Expression pattern analysis suggested that LPA1 influences plant architecture by affecting the gravitropism of leaf sheath pulvinus and lamina joint

## Connection
1. __LPA1__, __ONAC106__, [Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice ONAC106 inhibits leaf senescence and increases salt tolerance and tiller angle.%5BTitle%5D)),  Using yeast one-hybrid assays, we found that ONAC106 binds to the promoter regions of SGR, NYC1, OsNAC5, and LPA1
