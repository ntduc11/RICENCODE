## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ ga __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY24, which encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of both GA and ABA signaling, As to the GA signaling, OsWRKY24 differs from OsWRKY51 and -71, two negative regulators specifically function in the GA signaling pathway, in several ways, Third, unlike OsWRKY71, OsWRKY24 is stable upon GA treatment, Together, these data demonstrate that OsWRKY24 is a novel type of transcriptional repressor that inhibits both GA and ABA signaling
2. __ ABA __, [A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A negative regulator encoded by a rice WRKY gene represses both abscisic acid and gibberellins signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report a rice WRKY gene, OsWRKY24, which encodes a protein that functions as a negative regulator of both GA and ABA signaling, Together, these data demonstrate that OsWRKY24 is a novel type of transcriptional repressor that inhibits both GA and ABA signaling
3. __ ABA __, [Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Annotations and functional analyses of the rice WRKY gene superfamily reveal positive and negative regulators of abscisic acid signaling in aleurone cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Using a transient expression system, we have demonstrated that OsWRKY24 and -45 repress ABA induction of the HVA22 promoter-beta-glucuronidase construct, while OsWRKY72 and -77 synergistically interact with ABA to activate this reporter construct
