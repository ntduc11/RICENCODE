## Expression information

## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
2. __cold tolerance__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
3. __temperature__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid"
4. __transcription factor__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), OsWRKY76 encodes a group IIa WRKY transcription factor of rice
5. __blast__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid, Microarray analysis revealed that overexpression of OsWRKY76 suppresses the induction of a specific set of PR genes and of genes involved in phytoalexin synthesis after inoculation with blast fungus, consistent with the observation that the levels of phytoalexins in the transgenic rice plants remained significantly lower than those in non-transformed control plants, These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
6. __magnaporthe oryzae__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsWRKY76 was induced within 48h after inoculation with rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae), and by wounding, low temperature, benzothiadiazole, and abscisic acid
7. __blast disease__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
8. __abiotic stress__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), " Furthermore, overexpression of OsWRKY76 led to the increased expression of abiotic stress-associated genes such as peroxidase and lipid metabolism genes"
9. __disease__, [WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WRKY76 is a rice transcriptional repressor playing opposite roles in blast disease resistance and cold stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  These results strongly suggest that OsWRKY76 plays dual and opposing roles in blast disease resistance and cold tolerance
10. __transcription factor__, [OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsWRKY28, a PAMP-responsive transrepressor, negatively regulates innate immune responses in rice against rice blast fungus%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression analyses of the group IIa WRKY transcription factors in rice revealed that OsWRKY28, together with OsWRKY71, exhibit an early-induced expression prior to the late-induced expressions of OsWRKY62 and OsWRKY76
