## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Analysis of OsWRKY42-GFP expression and its effects on transcriptional activation in maize protoplasts suggested that the OsWRKY42 protein functions as a nuclear transcriptional repressor |  Expression analysis of ROS producing and scavenging genes revealed that the metallothionein genes clustered on chromosome 12, especially OsMT1d, were strongly repressed in OsWRKY42OX plants |  An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts  
__OverExpression__: An OsMT1d promoter:LUC construct was found to be repressed by OsWRKY42 overexpression in rice protoplasts  
__RNAi__:
