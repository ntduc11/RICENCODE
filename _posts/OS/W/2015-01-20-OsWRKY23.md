## Expression information

## Key message
1. __salicylic acid__, [Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Under biotic and abiotic stresses treatments, OsWRKY23 was markedly induced by continuous-dark-induced leaf senescence and infection by rice pathogen Pyricularia oryzae Cav as well as salicylic acid (SA)
2. __growth__, [Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Under normal growth conditions, OsWRKY23 expressed exclusively in roots and senescing leaves
3. __root__, [Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Under normal growth conditions, OsWRKY23 expressed exclusively in roots and senescing leaves
4. __defense__, [Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)), Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis
5. __leaf__, [Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Under biotic and abiotic stresses treatments, OsWRKY23 was markedly induced by continuous-dark-induced leaf senescence and infection by rice pathogen Pyricularia oryzae Cav as well as salicylic acid (SA), Furthermore, over-expression of OsWRKY23 accelerated leaf senescence in darkness, In conclusion, these results suggest that OsWRKY23 is a novel modulator of pathogen responses as well as dark-induced leaf senescence,Heterologous expression of OsWRKY23 gene enhances pathogen defense and dark-induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis
