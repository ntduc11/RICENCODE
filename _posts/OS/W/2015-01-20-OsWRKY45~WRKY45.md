## Expression information
__Expression__:Development of disease-resistant rice by optimized expression of WRKY45. |  This was achieved by optimizing the promoter driving WRKY45 expression |  We isolated 16 constitutive promoters from rice genomic DNA and tested their ability to drive WRKY45 expression |  Comparisons among different transformant lines showed that, overall, the strength of WRKY45 expression was positively correlated with disease resistance and negatively correlated with agronomic traits |  Interestingly, excessive WRKY45 expression rendered rice plants sensitive to low temperature and salinity, and stress sensitivity was correlated with the induction of defence genes by these stresses
