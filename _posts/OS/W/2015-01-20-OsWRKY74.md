1. [OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsWRKY74, a WRKY transcription factor, modulates tolerance to phosphate starvation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, J Exp Bot.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Overexpression of OsWRKY74 significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, whereas transgenic lines with down-regulation of OsWRKY74 were sensitive to Pi starvation |  Expression patterns of a number of Pi-responsive genes were altered in the OsWRKY74-overexpressing and RNA interference lines  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of OsWRKY74 significantly enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation, whereas transgenic lines with down-regulation of OsWRKY74 were sensitive to Pi starvation  
__RNAi__:
