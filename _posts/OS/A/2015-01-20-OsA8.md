## Key message
1. __root__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  It is reported here that OsA8, a typical PM H(+)-ATPases gene that was predominantly expressed in roots of rice, is down-regulated by nutrient deficiency, The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions, Knockout of OsA8 affected the expression of several OsA genes and the high affinity phosphate transporter, OsPT6, and resulted in a higher P concentration in the roots and a lower amount of P in the shoots, These analyses demonstrate that OsA8 not only influences the uptake of P by roots, but also the translocation of P from the roots to the shoots in rice
2. __phosphorus__, [Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The Osa8 mutant had a relatively smaller size and root to shoot biomass ratio, but higher ATPase activity than its wild-type counterparts under phosphorus (P) starvation conditions,Proton pump OsA8 is linked to phosphorus uptake and translocation in rice
