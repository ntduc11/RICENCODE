## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transporter__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsALS1 encodes a half-size ABC transporter that is a member of the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) sub-group
2. __transcription factor__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we functionally characterized a rice gene, Os03g0755100 (OsALS1), that is regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor
3. __root__, [A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A tonoplast-localized half-size ABC transporter is required for internal detoxification of aluminum in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsALS1 was rapidly and specifically induced by Al in the roots, but not by other metals or low pH, OsALS1 was localized at all cells of the roots, Comparison of Al accumulation patterns between wild-type and osals1 mutants showed that there was no difference in Al levels in the cell sap of root tips between wild-type and the mutants, but the mutants accumulated more Al in the cytosol and nucleus than the wild-type
