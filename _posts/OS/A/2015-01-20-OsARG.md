## Expression information
__Expression__:Expression of the Rice Arginase Gene OsARG in Cotton Influences the Morphology and Nitrogen Transition of Seedlings. |  Two independent OsARG expression transgenic cotton lines, ARG-26 and ARG-38, were obtained via transformation |  The nitric oxide content and the morphology of ARG-26 and ARG-38 seedlings were both affected by expression of the OsARG gene  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsARG protein was localized in the mitochondria, consistent with other arginases
2. __grain__, [OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
3. __nitrogen__, [OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The phenotype was partially corrected supplying exogenous nitrogen, and fully corrected by a wild type OsARG transgene, Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen
4. __panicle__, [OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsARG, ubiquitously expressed in various organs, was more strongly expressed in the developing panicles, Our results suggest that the arginase encoded by OsARG, a key enzyme in Arg catabolism, plays a critical role during panicle development, especially under conditions of insufficient exogenous nitrogen,OsARG encodes an arginase that plays critical roles in panicle development and grain production in rice
