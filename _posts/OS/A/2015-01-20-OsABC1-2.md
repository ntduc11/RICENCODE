## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Characterization of an Abc1 kinase family gene OsABC1-2 conferring enhanced tolerance to dark-induced stress in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of an Abc1 kinase family gene OsABC1-2 conferring enhanced tolerance to dark-induced stress in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The mutated gene, designated OsABC1-2, is expressed primarily in green tissues and/or organs and encodes a protein localized in chloroplast envelope, Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the plant Abc1 proteins could be divided into three subgroups and OsAbc1-2 resides in a subgroup with potential chloroplast origin
