__RAPdb__: [Os05g0323800](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os05g0323800)  

## Publication
1. [OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, J Exp Bot.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression of OsAGSW1-GFP in rice revealed that OsAGSW1 is localized to the chloroplasts in rice  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: Furthermore, OsAGSW1-RNAi and overexpressed transgenic rice lines were generated |  Stable transgenic lines overexpressing OsAGSW1 exhibited a phenotype with a significant increase in grain size, grain weight, grain filling rate and 1000-grain weight compared with the wild-type and RNAi transgenic plants |  Microscopy analysis showed that spikelet hulls just before heading were different in the OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants compared with wild-type and OsAGSW1 RNAi rice |  Further cytological analysis showed that the number of external parenchyma cells in rice hulls of OsAGSW1-overexpressed plants increased, leading to wider and longer spikelet hulls than those of the wild-type and OsAGSW1-RNAi plants  

## Key message
1. __vascular bundle__, [OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Analysis of OsAGSW1 promoter::Î²-glucuronidase transgenic rice indicated that this gene was highly expressed in vascular bundles in shoot, hull and caryopsis
2. __vascular bundle__, [OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAGSW1, an ABC1-like kinase gene, is involved in the regulation of grain size and weight in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, our results demonstrated that OsAGSW1 plays an important role in seed shape and size of rice by regulating the number of external parenchyma cells and the development of vascular bundles, providing a new insight into the functions of ABC1 genes in plants
