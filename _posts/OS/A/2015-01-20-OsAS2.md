## Expression information

## Key message
1. __nitrogen__, [Biological functions of asparagine synthetase in plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Biological functions of asparagine synthetase in plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic and molecular data using mutants and transgenic plants have provided insights into the light perception by the photoreceptors, carbon and nitrogen sensing and signal transduction mechanism in the asn regulation, Global analysis of carbon and nitrogen metabolites supports the impact of asn regulation in the synthesis and transport of asparagine in plants
2. __leaf__, [Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, OsAS2 mRNA was abundant in leaf blades and sheathes of rice
