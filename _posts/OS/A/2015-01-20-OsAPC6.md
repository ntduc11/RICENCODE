## Key message
1. __seed__, [Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6%5BTitle%5D)), A T-DNA insertional mutant OsAPC6 of rice, with gibberellic acid insensitivity and reduced height, had up to 45% reduced seed set, Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) studies of megagametophyte development showed abnormal mitotic divisions with reduced number or total absence of polar nuclei in about 30-35% megagametophytes of OsAPC6 mutant leading to failure of endosperm and hence embryo and seed development
2. __endosperm__, [Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6%5BTitle%5D)),  Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) studies of megagametophyte development showed abnormal mitotic divisions with reduced number or total absence of polar nuclei in about 30-35% megagametophytes of OsAPC6 mutant leading to failure of endosperm and hence embryo and seed development,Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6
3. __dwarf__, [A candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion%5BTitle%5D)), A dwarf mutant (Oryza sativa anaphase-promoting complex 6 (OsAPC6)) of rice cultivar Basmati 370 with 50% reduced plant height as compared to the wild type was isolated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using Hm(R) Ds cassette
4. __height__, [Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6%5BTitle%5D)), A T-DNA insertional mutant OsAPC6 of rice, with gibberellic acid insensitivity and reduced height, had up to 45% reduced seed set
5. __height__, [A candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate gene OsAPC6 of anaphase-promoting complex of rice identified through T-DNA insertion%5BTitle%5D)), A dwarf mutant (Oryza sativa anaphase-promoting complex 6 (OsAPC6)) of rice cultivar Basmati 370 with 50% reduced plant height as compared to the wild type was isolated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using Hm(R) Ds cassette, The knockout mutant OsAPC6 interferes with the gibberellic acid signaling pathway leading to reduced height and cell size probably through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
6. __seed development__, [Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6%5BTitle%5D)),  Confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) studies of megagametophyte development showed abnormal mitotic divisions with reduced number or total absence of polar nuclei in about 30-35% megagametophytes of OsAPC6 mutant leading to failure of endosperm and hence embryo and seed development
7. __sterility__, [Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6%5BTitle%5D)),  Abnormal female gametophyte development, high sterility and segregation of tall and gibberellic acid sensitive plants without selectable marker Hpt in the selfed progeny of OsAPC6 mutant plants indicate that the mutant could be maintained in heterozygous condition,Abnormal endosperm development causes female sterility in rice insertional mutant OsAPC6
