## Expression information

## Key message
1. __phosphate__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  OsACP1 expression was up-regulated in the rice plant and in cell culture in the absence of phosphate (Pi)
2. __root__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
3. __insect__, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsACP1 cDNA was expressed as a 30 kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells
4. __ pi __, [A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A phosphate starvation-induced acid phosphatase from Oryza sativa: phosphate regulation and transgenic expression%5BTitle%5D)),  The induced expression of OsACP1 was a specific response to Pi starvation, and was not affected by the deprivation of other nutrients, OsACP1 expression was responsive to the level of Pi supply, with transcripts of OsACP1 being abundant in Pi-deprived root
