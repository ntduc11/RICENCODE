## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots, Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots
2. __ ja __, [OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
3. __chloroplast__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  The analysis of deduced amino acid sequences indicated that only OsAOS1 has a chloroplast transit peptide among all the identified monocot AOSs including OsAOSs
4. __shoot__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots, Our results also indicated that OsAOS1, responding to both light and wounding, is the most highly expressed of all the OsAOSs in seedling shoots

## Connection
1. __OsAOS1__, __OsHI-LOX__, [OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMPK3 positively regulates the JA signaling pathway and plant resistance to a chewing herbivore in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Silencing OsMPK3 (ir-mpk3) reduced the expression of the gene by 50-70 %, decreased elicited levels of JA and diminished the expression of a lipoxygenase gene OsHI-LOX and an allene oxide synthase gene OsAOS1
2. __OsAOS1__, __OsAOS4~OsHPL1__, [Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE in rice seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the transcripts of OsAOS1 and OsAOS4 are up-regulated by red and far-red light in seedling shoots, The response in OsAOS1 transcripts occurred rapidly and transiently, while the response in OsAOS4 transcripts was slower and more sustainable; the maximal enhancement was greater in OsAOS1 transcripts than in OsAOS4 transcripts
