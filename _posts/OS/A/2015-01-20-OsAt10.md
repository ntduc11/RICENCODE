## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification%5BTitle%5D)),  An activation-tagged line, OsAT10-D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide-bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p-CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition
2. __yield__, [Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification%5BTitle%5D)),  Biomass from OsAT10-D1 exhibits a 20% to 40% increase in saccharification yield depending on the assay
3. __vegetative__, [Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification%5BTitle%5D)),  An activation-tagged line, OsAT10-D1, shows a 60% reduction in matrix polysaccharide-bound FA and an approximately 300% increase in p-CA in young leaf tissue but no discernible phenotypic alterations in vegetative development, lignin content, or lignin composition
4. __biomass__, [Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification%5BTitle%5D)),  Biomass from OsAT10-D1 exhibits a 20% to 40% increase in saccharification yield depending on the assay
5. __cell wall__, [Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, OsAt10 is an attractive target for improving grass cell wall quality for fuel and animal feed,Overexpression of a BAHD acyltransferase, OsAt10, alters rice cell wall hydroxycinnamic acid content and saccharification
