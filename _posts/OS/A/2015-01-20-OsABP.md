## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress%5BTitle%5D)), " In the present study, we report on the identification of a new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice which is upregulated in response e to multiple abiotic stress treatments including NaCl, dehydration, ABA, blue and red light, These results imply that OsABP might perform important functions in the cellular response to specific abiotic stress,A new DEAD-box helicase ATP-binding protein (OsABP) from rice is responsive to abiotic stress"
