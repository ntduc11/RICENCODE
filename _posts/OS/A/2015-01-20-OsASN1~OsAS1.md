## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Cell-type and NH4 (+) inducible expression of OsAS1 as well as analyses of knockout mutants were carried out in this study to characterize AS1 |  Characteristics of the NH4 (+)-dependent increase and the root-surface cell-specific expression of OsAS1 gene are very similar to our previous results on cytosolic glutamine synthetase1;2 and NADH-glutamate synthase1 in rice roots  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __root__, [Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Asparagine synthetase1, but not asparagine synthetase2, is responsible for the biosynthesis of asparagine following the supply of ammonium to rice roots.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsAS1 was mainly expressed in the roots with in situ hybridization showing that the corresponding mRNA was specifically accumulated in the three cell layers of root surface (epidermis, exodermis, and sclerenchyma) in an NH4 (+)-dependent manner
