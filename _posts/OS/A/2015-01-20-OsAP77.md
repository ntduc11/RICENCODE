## Information
__Symbol__: OsAP77  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os10g39260](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os10g39260)  
__RAPdb__: [Os10g0537800](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os10g0537800)  

## Publication
1. [Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Rice (N Y).

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: We previously reported that the expression of a rice AP gene (OsAP77, Os10g0537800) was induced by probenazole (PBZ), a chemical inducer of disease resistance | To elucidate the spatial and temporal expression of OsAP77, the chimeric gene was constructed carrying the structural gene encoding Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by the OsAP77 promoter | These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __defense__, [Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections
2. __defense response__, [Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), These results suggest that the expression of OsAP77 is induced by pathogen infection and defense related signaling molecules in a vascular tissue specific manner and that this gene has a positive role of defense response against fungal, bacterial and viral infections
3. __ABA__, [Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Response of an aspartic protease gene OsAP77 to fungal, bacterial and viral infections in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis showed that OsAP77 was induced not only by infection with these pathogens, but also after treatment with SA, INA, H2O2 or ABA
