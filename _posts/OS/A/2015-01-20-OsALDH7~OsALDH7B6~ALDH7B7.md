## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed development__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D)),  These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly
2. __endosperm__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, endosperms from the osaldh7 null mutants accumulated brown pigments during desiccation and storage
3. __blast__, [Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and differential expression of an aldehyde dehydrogenase gene in rice leaves in response to infection by blast fungus%5BTitle%5D)),  Using diï¬€erential display RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, a full-length aldehyde dehydrogenase cDNA (ALDH7B7) was isolated from rice leaves infected by incompatible race of blast fungus Magnaporthe grisea, ALDH7B7 expression was induced by blast fungus infection, ultraviolet, mechanical wound in rice leaves and was not detected in untreated rice organs, The function of ALDH7B7 in the interaction process between blast fungus and rice is discussed
4. __seed__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D)),  These pigments started to accumulate in the late seed developmental stage, the time when OsALDH7 expression began to increase significantly, These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation, These data imply that OsALDH7 plays an important role in maintaining seed viability by detoxifying the aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation
5. __endosperm__, [Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we reported a mutant with yellow-colored endosperm in rice, and showed that the yellow endosperm was caused by mutation of OsALDH7,Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice
6. __abiotic stress__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D)), " We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses"
7. __seed__, [Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of OsALDH7 causes a yellow-colored endosperm associated with accumulation of oryzamutaic acid A in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsALDH7 is expressed in all tissues detected, with the highest level in mature seeds
8. __oxidative__, [Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice aldehyde dehydrogenase7 is needed for seed maturation and viability%5BTitle%5D)), " We obtained T-DNA insertional mutants in OsALDH7, which is remarkably inducible by oxidative and abiotic stresses, These results suggest that OsALDH7 is involved in removing various aldehydes formed by oxidative stress during seed desiccation"
