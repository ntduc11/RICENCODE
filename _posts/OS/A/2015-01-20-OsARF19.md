## Publication
1. [The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The auxin response factor, OsARF19, controls rice leaf angles through positively regulating OsGH3-5 and OsBRI1.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Plant Cell Environ.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: We here report that OsARF19-overexpression rice lines show an enlarged lamina inclination due to increase of its adaxial cell division |  Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and yeast one-hybrid assays demonstrate that OsARF19 binds to the promoter of OsGH3-5 and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (OsBRI1) directing their expression |  OsGH3-5-overexpression lines show a similar phenotype as OsARF19-O1 |  OsARF19-overexpression lines are sensitive to exogenous BR treatment and alter the expressions of genes related to BR signalling  
__OverExpression__: We here report that OsARF19-overexpression rice lines show an enlarged lamina inclination due to increase of its adaxial cell division |  OsGH3-5-overexpression lines show a similar phenotype as OsARF19-O1 |  OsARF19-overexpression lines are sensitive to exogenous BR treatment and alter the expressions of genes related to BR signalling
