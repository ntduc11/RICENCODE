## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice
2. __pollen__, [Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.%5BTitle%5D)),  osabcg26 osabcg15 double mutant displays an almost complete absence of anther cuticle and pollen exine, similar to that of osabcg15 single mutant
3. __pollen__, [Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, we propose that OsABCG26 and OsABCG15 collaboratively regulate rice male reproduction: OsABCG26 is mainly responsible for the transport of lipidic molecules from tapetal cells to anther wall layers, while OsABCG15 mainly is responsible for the export of lipidic molecules from the tapetal cells to anther locules for pollen exine development
4. __anther__, [Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two ATP Binding Cassette G (ABCG) Transporters, OsABCG26 and OsABCG15, Collaboratively Regulate Rice Male Reproduction.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the significant role of OsABCG26 in regulating the development of anther cuticle and pollen exine together with OsABCG15 in rice
