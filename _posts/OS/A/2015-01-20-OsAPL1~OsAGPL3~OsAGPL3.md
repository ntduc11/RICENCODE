## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Identification of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase isoforms essential for starch synthesis in the leaf and seed endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase isoforms essential for starch synthesis in the leaf and seed endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Subcellular localization studies using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion constructs indicate that OsAGPS2a, the product of the leaf-preferential transcript of OsAGPS2, and OsAGPS1, OsAGPL1, OsAGPL3, and OsAGPL4 are plastid-targeted isoforms
2. __seed__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D)),  OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
3. __leaf__, [A mutant of rice lacking the leaf large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has drastically reduced leaf starch content but grows normally](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A mutant of rice lacking the leaf large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has drastically reduced leaf starch content but grows normally%5BTitle%5D)),  Characterisation of the mutant (apl1) showed that the LSU encoded by OsAPL1 is required for AGPase activity in rice leaf blades
4. __seed development__, [Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gene expression of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and starch contents in rice cultured cells are cooperatively regulated by sucrose and ABA%5BTitle%5D)),  OsAPL3 was predominantly expressed in the middle phases of seed development, and OsAPS1, OsAPL1 and OsAPL2 were expressed later in seed development
