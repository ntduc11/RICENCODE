## Key message
1. __shoot__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Disruption of OsARID3 leads to defective SAM, early seedling lethality, and impaired capacity of in vitro shoot regeneration
2. __seedling__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Disruption of OsARID3 leads to defective SAM, early seedling lethality, and impaired capacity of in vitro shoot regeneration
3. __development__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We conclude that OsARID3 is an AT-rich specific DNA-binding protein and that it plays a major role in SAM development in rice
4. __auxin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that the expression levels of several KNOXI genes and the biosynthetic genes for auxin and cytokinin are significantly altered in the Osarid3 mutant calli
5. __auxin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, we determine that auxin concentrations are increased whereas cytokinin levels are decreased in Osarid3 calli
6. __auxin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7
7. __cytokinin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that the expression levels of several KNOXI genes and the biosynthetic genes for auxin and cytokinin are significantly altered in the Osarid3 mutant calli
8. __cytokinin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, we determine that auxin concentrations are increased whereas cytokinin levels are decreased in Osarid3 calli
9. __cytokinin__, [OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsARID3, an AT-rich Interaction Domain-containing protein, is required for shoot meristem development in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, our chromatin immunoprecipitation results demonstrate that OsARID3 binds directly to the KNOXI gene OSH71, the auxin biosynthetic genes OsYUC1 and OsYUC6, and the cytokinin biosynthetic genes OsIPT2 and OsIPT7
