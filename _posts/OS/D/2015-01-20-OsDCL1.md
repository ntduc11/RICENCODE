## Expression information
__Expression__: Expression profiling demonstrated that different OsDCLs responded dynamically and OsDCL1 reduced its expression upon the challenge of rice blast pathogen |  In contrast, miR162a predicted to target OsDCL1 increased its expression, implying a negative feedback loop between OsDCL1 and miR162a in rice |  Moreover, silencing of OsDCL1 activated the constitutive expression of defense related genes  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: In OsDCL1 RNAi lines, 12 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, of which 5 and 7 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, indicating that miRNAs responded dynamically in the interaction between rice and rice blast
