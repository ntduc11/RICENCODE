## Expression information

## Key message
1. __flowering time__, [Functional characterization of rice OsDof12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of rice OsDof12%5BTitle%5D)),  The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions
2. __flower__, [Functional characterization of rice OsDof12](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional characterization of rice OsDof12%5BTitle%5D)),  The transgenic lines overexpressing OsDof12 showed early flowering under long-day (LD) conditions, whereas OsDof12 overexpression had no effect on flowering time under short-day (SD) conditions, These results suggested that OsDof12 might regulate flowering by controlling the expression of Hd3a and OsMADS14
