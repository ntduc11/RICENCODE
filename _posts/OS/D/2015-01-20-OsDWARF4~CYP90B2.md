## Key message
1. __brassinosteroid__, [Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer, Molecular and biochemical studies reveal that two different cytochrome P450s, CYP90B2/OsDWARF4 and CYP724B1/D11, function redundantly in C-22 hydroxylation, the rate-limiting step of brassinosteroid biosynthesis, Therefore, despite the central role of brassinosteroids in plant growth and development, mutation of OsDWARF4 alone causes only limited defects in brassinosteroid biosynthesis and plant morphology
2. __grain__, [Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Erect leaves caused by brassinosteroid deficiency increase biomass production and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the erect leaf phenotype of a rice brassinosteroid-deficient mutant, osdwarf4-1, is associated with enhanced grain yields under conditions of dense planting, even without extra fertilizer
