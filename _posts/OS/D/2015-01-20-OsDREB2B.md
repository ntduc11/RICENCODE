## Expression information

## Key message
1. __drought__, [Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing OsDREB2B showed enhanced expression of DREB2A target genes and improved drought and heat-shock stress tolerance
2. __transcription factor__, [Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsDREB2B is a key gene that encodes a stress-inducible DREB2-type transcription factor that functions in stress-responsive gene expression in rice
3. __abiotic stress__, [Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Comprehensive analysis of rice DREB2-type genes that encode transcription factors involved in the expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes%5BTitle%5D)),  Only OsDREB2A and OsDREB2B showed abiotic stress-inducible gene expression

## Connection
1. __OsDREB2B__, __OsMKK1__, [The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade MKK1-MPK4 mediates salt signaling in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  By comparing the transcription factors levels between WT and osmkk1 mutant, OsMKK1 was necessary for salt-induced increase in OsDREB2B and OsMYBS3
