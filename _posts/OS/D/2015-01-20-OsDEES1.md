## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seed__, [The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development%5BTitle%5D)),  A detailed investigation of the ovaries from OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated that the knockdown of OsDEES1 expression did not affect megasporogenesis but that it disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting in a degenerated embryo sac and defective seed formation, OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
2. __flower__, [The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
3. __sterility__, [The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDEES1 silencing by RNA interference caused a high rate of female sterility
4. __seedling__, [The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDEES1 exhibited a tissue-specific expression pattern in flowers and seedlings
5. __reproductive__, [The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice wall-associated receptor-like kinase gene OsDEES1 plays a role in female gametophyte development%5BTitle%5D)),  Crossing experiments showed that female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried a functional defect
