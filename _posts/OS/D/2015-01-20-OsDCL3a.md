## Key message
1. __brassinosteroid__, [Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle
2. __dwarf__, [Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches, OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle
3. __leaf__, [Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Impairing OsDCL3a expression by RNA interference caused phenotypes affecting important agricultural traits; these phenotypes include dwarfism, larger flag leaf angle, and fewer secondary branches, OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle

5. __gibberellin__, [Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dicer-like 3 produces transposable element-associated 24-nt siRNAs that control agricultural traits in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDCL3a directly targets genes involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid homeostasis; OsDCL3a deficiency may affect these genes, thus causing the phenotypes of dwarfism and enlarged flag leaf angle

## Connection
1. __OsDCL3a__, __OsDCL3b__, [Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of DCL4 and DCL3b in rice phased small RNA biogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Surprisingly, the processing of 24-nucleotide phased small RNA requires the DCL3 homolog OsDCL3b rather than OsDCL3a, suggesting functional divergence within DCL3 family
