## Key message
1. __drought__, [Rice Gene OsDSR-1 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Gene OsDSR-1 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions%5BTitle%5D)), Rice gene Oryza sativa Drought Stress Response-1 (OsDSR-1) was one of the genes identified to be responsive to drought stress in the panicle of rice at booting and heading stages by both microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses
2. __potassium__, [Rice Gene OsDSR-1 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Gene OsDSR-1 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  Further analysis showed that external Ca2+ was required for the production of larger root systems, indicating that the promotion by OsDSR-1 of the LR development of transgenic Arabidopsis seemed to occur in a Ca2+-dependent manner under high-potassium conditions, We propose that OsDSR-1 may function as a calcium sensor of the signal transduction pathway controlling the LR development under high-potassium conditions,Rice Gene OsDSR-1 Promotes Lateral Root Development in Arabidopsis Under High-Potassium Conditions
