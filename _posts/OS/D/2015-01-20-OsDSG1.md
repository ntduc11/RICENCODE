## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the osdsg1 mutant, transcript levels of ABA signaling genes and ABA responsive genes were significantly increased, These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds
2. __root__, [A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds
3. __seed__, [A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  There, T-DNA was inserted into Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), causing a recessive null mutation, Real-time PCR analysis revealed that OsDSG1 was expressed in leaves and roots, and strongly in developing seeds, These observations support that OsDSG1 is a major regulator of ABA signaling in germinating seeds,A RING finger E3 ligase gene, Oryza sativa Delayed Seed Germination 1 (OsDSG1), controls seed germination and stress responses in rice
