## Key message
1. __cold stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDEG10 RNAi transgenic plants were more sensitive to high light and cold stresses compared to wild-type plants
2. __abiotic stress__, [OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling%5BTitle%5D)), " Among them, OsDEG10 is predicted to encode a small RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the transcript levels of OsDEG10 strongly increased under most of abiotic stress treatments such as high light, anoxia, NaCl, ABA, MV and cold, Our results suggest that OsDEG10 is a small RBP involved in the response to various abiotic stresses,OsDEG10 encoding a small RNA-binding protein is involved in abiotic stress signaling"
