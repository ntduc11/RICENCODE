## Key message
1. __sterility__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility, The sterility phenotypes were associated with down-regulated OsDMC1 transcript and protein levels mediated by RNAi
2. __root__, [Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
3. __pollen__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility
4. __spikelet__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility

7. __meiotic__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Further cytological observations of male meiocytes revealed that knock-down of OsDMC1 led to defects in bivalent formation and subsequent unequal chromosome segregation and irregular spore generation, and induced changes in male meiotic progression
8. __vegetative__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsDMC1-RNAi lines grew normally during their vegetative phase but showed spikelet and pollen sterility

10. __anther__, [DNA binding and pairing activity of OsDmc1, a recombinase from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DNA binding and pairing activity of OsDmc1, a recombinase from rice%5BTitle%5D)), A cloned cDNA corresponding to OsDMC1 from rice anther tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli
11. __meiosis__, [OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMC1 is required for homologous pairing in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we analyzed the function of OsDMC1 in meiosis using an RNA interference approach, These data indicate that OsDMC1 is essential for rice meiosis and plays an important role in homologous pairing
12. __seedling__, [Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of OsDMC1 , the rice homologue of the yeast DMC1 gene essential for meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsDMC1 was expressed at high-levels in reproductive organs, low-levels in roots, and undetectable levels in leaves and seedlings
