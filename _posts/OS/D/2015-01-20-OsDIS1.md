## Key message
1. __salt__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
2. __drought tolerance__, [The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance"
3. __salt stress__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
4. __drought__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " We recently showed that OsDIS1 (Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a SINA type E3 ligase, is involved in the drought-stress signal transduction in rice, OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through the transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and also possibly through the posttranslational regulation of its interacting protein OsNek6 in rice, Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice"
5. __drought__, [The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Here, we report that OsDIS1 (for Oryza sativa drought-induced SINA protein 1), a C3HC4 RING finger E3 ligase, is involved in drought-stress signal transduction in rice (O, The expression of OsDIS1 was up-regulated by drought treatment, Overexpression of OsDIS1 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic rice plants, while RNA interference silencing of OsDIS1 enhanced drought tolerance, Microarray analysis revealed that a large number of drought-responsive genes were induced or suppressed in the OsDIS1 overexpression plants under normal and drought conditions, Together, these results demonstrate that OsDIS1 plays a negative role in drought stress tolerance through transcriptional regulation of diverse stress-related genes and possibly through posttranslational regulation of OsNek6 in rice,The SINA E3 ligase OsDIS1 negatively regulates drought response in rice"

## Connection
1. __OsDIS1__, __OsSKIPa__, [OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDIS1-mediated stress response pathway in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we also show that OsDIS1 interacts with OsSKIPa, a drought and salt stress positive regulator in rice
