## Key message
1. __culm__, [The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching
2. __auxin__, [OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 downregulation via OsmiR393 overexpression leads to more tillers, early flowering and less tolerance to salt and drought in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of an auxin transporter (OsAUX1) and a tillering inhibitor (OsTB1) were downregulated by overexpression of OsmiR393, which suggested that a gene chain from OsmiR393 to rice tillering may be from OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 to OsAUX1, which affected the transportation of auxin, then to OsTB1, which finally controlled tillering
3. __branching__, [The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching
4. __branching__, [FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that FC1 acts as an integrator of multiple signaling pathways and is essential to the fine-tuning of shoot branching in rice
5. __cytokinin__, [FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, the expression level of FC1 is negatively regulated by cytokinin treatment
6. __growth__, [The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The interaction between OsMADS57 and OsTB1 modulates rice tillering via DWARF14%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report that OsMADS57 interacts with OsTB1 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1) and targets D14 (Dwarf14) to control the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice
7. __shoot__, [The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsTB1, as examined with a putative promoter-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fusion, was observed throughout the axillary bud, as well as the basal part of the shoot apical meristem, vascular tissues in the pith and the lamina joint
8. __meristem__, [FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An in situ hybridization analysis showed that FC1 mRNA accumulates in axillary buds, the shoot apical meristem, young leaves, vascular tissues and the tips of crown roots
9. __tiller__, [FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(FINE CULM1 (FC1) works downstream of strigolactones to inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that the increased tillering phenotype of fine culm1 (fc1) mutants of rice is not rescued by the application of 1 microM GR24, a synthetic SL analog, Treatment with a high concentration of GR24 (10 microM) causes suppression of tiller growth in wild-type plants, but is not effective on fc1 mutants, implying that proper FC1 functioning is required for SLs to inhibit bud growth, Overexpression of FC1 partially rescued d3-2 defects in the tiller growth and plant height
10. __branching__, [The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice TB1 gene (OsTB1) was first identified based on its sequence similarity with maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (TB1), which is involved in lateral branching in maize, Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsTB1 exhibited markedly reduced lateral branching without the propagation of axillary buds being affected, We also demonstrated that a rice strain carrying a classical morphological marker mutation, fine culm 1 (fc1), contain the loss-of-function mutation of OsTB1 and exhibits enhanced lateral branching, Taking these data together, we concluded that OsTB1 functions as a negative regulator for lateral branching in rice, presumably through expression in axillary buds,The OsTB1 gene negatively regulates lateral branching in rice
