## Key message
1. __flowering time__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa), Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
2. __height__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
3. __grain number__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
4. __flower__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we observed that suppression of Oryza sativa Trithorax1 (OsTrx1), an ortholog of ATX1, delayed flowering time in rice (Oryza sativa), Our results suggest that OsTrx1 plays an important role in regulating flowering time in rice by modulating chromatin structure
5. __grain__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
6. __heading date__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1

## Connection
1. __Ehd3__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  We demonstrated that the plant homeodomain motif of OsTrx1 binds to native histone H3 from the calf thymus and that OsTrx1 binds to Ehd3 through the region between the plant homeodomain and SET domains
2. __Ghd7__, __OsTrx1~SDG723__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1, Because Trx group proteins form a complex with other proteins to modify the chromatin structure of target genes, we investigated whether OsTrx1 interacts with a previously identified protein that functions upstream of Ghd7
