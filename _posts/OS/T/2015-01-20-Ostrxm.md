## Key message
1. __dwarf__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content
2. __photosynthesis__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants
3. __chloroplast__, [Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Abnormal chloroplast development and growth inhibition in rice thioredoxin m knock-down plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Ostrxm was localized in chloroplasts of rice mesophyll cells, and the recombinant protein showed dithiothreitol-dependent insulin beta-chain reduction activity in vitro, RNA interference (RNAi) of Ostrxm resulted in rice plants with developmental defects, including semidwarfism, pale-green leaves, abnormal chloroplast structure, and reduced carotenoid and chlorophyll content, Two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis showed that the levels of several chloroplast proteins critical for photosynthesis and biogenesis were significantly decreased in Ostrxm RNAi plants, The pleiotropic effects of Ostrxm RNAi suggest that Ostrxm plays an important role in the redox regulation of chloroplast target proteins involved in diverse physiological functions
