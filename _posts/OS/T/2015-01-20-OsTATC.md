## Key message
1. __drought__, [Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene%5BTitle%5D)), " On the other hand, Ostatc, a mutant with weak phenotype, exhibited the pale green phenotype and slight increase in abscisic acid levels upon drought"

## Connection
1. __OsABA1~OSZEP1__, __OsTATC__, [Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Screening of the rice viviparous mutants generated by endogenous retrotransposon Tos17 insertion. Tagging of a zeaxanthin epoxidase gene and a novel ostatc gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Deduced amino acids of the causative genes of Osaba1 and Ostatc manifested a significantly high homology with zeaxanthin epoxidase isolated from other plant species and with bacterial Sec-independent translocase TATC protein, respectively
