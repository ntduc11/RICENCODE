## Publication
1. [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, BMC Plant Biol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Overexpression of OsTCTP potentiated the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, reduced the Hg-induced H2O2 levels, and promoted Hg tolerance in rice, whereas knockdown of OsTCTP produced opposite effects |  And overexpression of OsTCTP did not prevent Hg absorption and accumulation in rice  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of OsTCTP potentiated the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, reduced the Hg-induced H2O2 levels, and promoted Hg tolerance in rice, whereas knockdown of OsTCTP produced opposite effects |  And overexpression of OsTCTP did not prevent Hg absorption and accumulation in rice  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __tolerance__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsTCTP potentiated the activities of several antioxidant enzymes, reduced the Hg-induced H2O2 levels, and promoted Hg tolerance in rice, whereas knockdown of OsTCTP produced opposite effects
2. __tolerance__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
3. __stress__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
4. __abscisic acid__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsTCTP was induced by mercuric chloride, cupric sulfate, abscisic acid, and hydrogen peroxide at the protein level in a time-dependent manner
5. __nucleus__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsTCTP was found to localize both the cytosol and the nucleus
6. __reactive oxygen species__, [OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsTCTP, encoding a translationally controlled tumor protein, plays an important role in mercury tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), Our results suggest that OsTCTP is capable of decreasing the Hg-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), therefore, reducing the damage of ROS and enhancing the tolerance of rice plants to Hg stress
