## Key message
1. __homeostasis__, [Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results strongly suggest the involvement of OsIRL in homeostasis of ROS
2. __phytohormone__, [A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that the expression of OsIRL is positively regulated by phytohormones such as JA, and negatively by phytohormones such as SA, ABA
3. __root__, [Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species%5BTitle%5D)),  Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the OsIRL gene and protein were shown to be down-regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
4. __seedling__, [Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species%5BTitle%5D)),  Using Northern and Western blot analyses, the OsIRL gene and protein were shown to be down-regulated in young seedling roots treated with reduced glutathione (GSH) and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), known quenchers of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
5. __jasmonic acid__, [A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsIRL was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus
6. __jasmonic__, [A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsIRL was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus
7. __ ABA __, [Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of rice isoflavone reductase-like gene (OsIRL) confers tolerance to reactive oxygen species%5BTitle%5D)),  Results showed that the OsIRL transgenic rice line activated by ABA treatment was tolerant against MV and G/GO-induced stress in rice leave and suspension-cultured cells
8. __blast__, [A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsIRL was induced by treatment with a fungal elicitor and jasmonic acid as well as by inoculation with rice blast fungus,A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor
9. __salicylic acid__, [A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice isoflavone reductase-like gene, OsIRL, is induced by rice blast fungal elicitor%5BTitle%5D)),  Treatment with salicylic acid (SA, 5 mM) strongly inhibited expression of OsIRL in response to fungal elicitor and JA, while abscisic acid (ABA, 200 muM) also strongly antagonized OsIRL induction by JA, but had only a weak effect on induction by the fungal elicitor
