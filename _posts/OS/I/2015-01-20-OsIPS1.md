## Key message
1. __primary root__, [Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones%5BTitle%5D)),  An analysis of transgenic plants showed that OsIPS1/2 are independently responsive to Pi signalling and are mainly expressed in lateral roots and in the vascular cylinder in the primary root
2. __lateral root__, [Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones%5BTitle%5D)),  An analysis of transgenic plants showed that OsIPS1/2 are independently responsive to Pi signalling and are mainly expressed in lateral roots and in the vascular cylinder in the primary root
3. __phosphate__, [Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones%5BTitle%5D)),  Accumulation of the mRNA of OsIPS1/2 was examined by northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in whole-root and split-root experiments under treatment with phosphate (Pi) and the Pi analogue phosphite (Phi)
4. __shoot__, [Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones%5BTitle%5D)),  OsIPS1 showed much higher mRNA accumulation in roots than OsIPS2, and an opposite trend was seen in shoots
5. __ pi __, [Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones%5BTitle%5D)),  Accumulation of the mRNA of OsIPS1/2 was examined by northern blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in whole-root and split-root experiments under treatment with phosphate (Pi) and the Pi analogue phosphite (Phi), OsIPS1/2 showed both systemic and local responses to Pi starvation, and less than 10% of the overall induced mRNA level was due to the local Pi concentration in roots, An analysis of transgenic plants showed that OsIPS1/2 are independently responsive to Pi signalling and are mainly expressed in lateral roots and in the vascular cylinder in the primary root,Regulation of the expression of OsIPS1 and OsIPS2 in rice via systemic and local Pi signalling and hormones

## Connection
1. __OsIPS1__, __OsMYB2P-1__, [OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMYB2P-1, an R2R3 MYB transcription factor, is involved in the regulation of phosphate-starvation responses and root architecture in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMYB2P-1 led to greater expression of Pi-responsive genes such as Oryza sativa UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase, OsIPS1, OsPAP10, OsmiR399a, and OsmiR399j
