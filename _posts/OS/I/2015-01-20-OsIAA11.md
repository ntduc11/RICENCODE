## Connection
1. __OsCYP2~OsCyp2-P~LRT2__, __OsIAA11__, [Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of rice OsIAA11 catalysed by LATERAL ROOTLESS2 (LRT2), a cyclophilin-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase, directly regulates the stability of OsIAA11
2. __OsCYP2~OsCyp2-P~LRT2__, __OsIAA11__, [Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.%5BTitle%5D)),  NMR spectroscopy reveals that LRT2 efficiently catalyses the cis/trans isomerization of OsIAA11
3. __OsCYP2~OsCyp2-P~LRT2__, __OsIAA11__, [Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.%5BTitle%5D)),  The lrt2 mutation reduces OsTIR1-OsIAA11 interaction and consequently causes the accumulation of a higher level of OsIAA11 protein
4. __OsCYP2~OsCyp2-P~LRT2__, __OsIAA11__, [Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization targets rice Aux/IAAs for proteasomal degradation during auxin signalling.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, knockdown of the OsIAA11 expression partially rescues the lrt2 mutant phenotype in lateral root development
