## Expression information

## Key message
1. __abiotic stress__, [Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicated that OsIBR5 is a MKP which was induced by abiotic stresses and decreased tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants
2. __stomata__, [Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum%5BTitle%5D)),  Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls
3. __drought__, [Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum%5BTitle%5D)), " Overexpression of OsIBR5 in tobacco plants resulted in hypersensitivity to drought and H(2)O(2) treatments, Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls, Moreover, OsIBR5 was found to interact with tobacco MAPKs SIPK and WIPK, and drought-induced WIPK activity was impaired in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants, These results indicated that OsIBR5 is a MKP which was induced by abiotic stresses and decreased tolerance to drought stress in transgenic tobacco plants"
4. __stomatal__, [Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice MAPK phosphatase IBR5 negatively regulates drought stress tolerance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum%5BTitle%5D)),  Drought and ABA-induced stomatal closure was significantly reduced in OsIBR5-overexpressing tobacco plants compared with controls
