## Key message
1. __sterility__, [Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene

3. __ ja __, [Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of the OsOPR7 gene encoding 12-oxophytodienoate reductase involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we provide evidence that an OPR family gene in rice chromosome 8, designated OsOPR7, encodes the enzyme involved in the JA biosynthesis,5 h of mechanical wounding and drought stress, and the endogenous JA level started to increase in accordance with the increase in OsOPR7 expression, Furthermore, complementation analysis using an Arabidopsis opr3 mutant indicated that the OsOPR7 gene, but not OsOPR1, was able to complement the phenotypes of male sterility in the mutant caused by JA deficiency, and that JA production in the opr3 mutant was also restored by the expression of the OsOPR7 gene, We conclude that the OsOPR7 gene encodes the enzyme catalysing the reduction of natural (+)-cis-OPDA for the JA biosynthesis in rice
