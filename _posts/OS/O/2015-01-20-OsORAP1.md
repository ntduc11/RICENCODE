## Information
__Symbol__: OsORAP1  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os09g20090](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os09g20090)  
__RAPdb__: [Os09g0365900](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os09g0365900)  

## Publication
1. [A novel gene OsORAP1 enhances cell death in ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A novel gene OsORAP1 enhances cell death in ozone stress in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: It was localized in the apoplast as shown by transient expression of an OsORAP1/GFP fusion construct in tobacco leaf epidermal and mesophyll cells, but did not possess AO activity as shown by heterologous expression of OsORAP1 in Arabidopsis mutants with reduced background AO activity |  These pieces of evidence suggested that OsORAP1 enhanced cell death in ozone stress, and its expression levels could explain the effect of a previously reported QTL  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
