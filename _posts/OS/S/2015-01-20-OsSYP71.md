## Key message
1. __oxidative__, [Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), "OsSYP71 is an oxidative stress and rice blast response gene that encodes a Qc-SNARE protein in rice, Overexpression of OsSYP71 in rice showed more tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast than wild-type plants, These results indicate that Qc-SNAREs play an important role in rice response to environmental stresses, and OsSYP71 is useful in engineering crop plants with enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast,Overexpression of the Qc-SNARE gene OsSYP71 enhances tolerance to oxidative stress and resistance to rice blast in rice (Oryza sativa L.)"
