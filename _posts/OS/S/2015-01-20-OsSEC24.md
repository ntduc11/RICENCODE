## Key message
1. __tolerance__, [OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.%5BTitle%5D)),  To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts
2. __iron__, [OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.%5BTitle%5D)),  To explore how OsSEC24 confers tolerance to iron deficiency, we utilized transgenic tobacco, rice and rice protoplasts
3. __iron__, [OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.%5BTitle%5D)),  H(+) flux measurements using Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) indicated that the transgenic OsSEC24 tobacco and rice enhanced H(+) efflux under iron deficiency
4. __iron__, [OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, OsSEC24 vesicles, along with PM-H(+)-ATPases stimulate roots formation under iron deficiency by enhancing rhizosphere acidification
5. __plasma membrane__, [OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSEC24, a functional SEC24-like protein in rice, improves tolerance to iron deficiency and high pH by enhancing H(+) secretion mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase.%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, the application of plasma membrane PM-H(+)-ATPase inhibitor vanadate elucidated that H(+) secretion increased by OsSEC24 was mediated by PM-H(+)-ATPase
