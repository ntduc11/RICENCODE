## Connection
1. __OsSUT4__, __WOX11__, [Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Improving rice tolerance to potassium deficiency by enhancing OsHAK16p:WOX11-controlled root development%5BTitle%5D)), The improvement of sugar partitioning to the roots by the expression of OsHAK16p:WOX11 was further indicated by increasing the expression of OsSUT1 and OsSUT4 genes in leaf blades and several OsMSTs genes in roots.
2. __OsNF-YB1__, __OsSUT4__, [NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)), In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4
