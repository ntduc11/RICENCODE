## Expression information

## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed
2. __vegetative__, [OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice plants with loss-of-function of OsSPO11-1 have no apparent growth defects during vegetative development, but homologous chromosome pairing and recombination are significantly obstructed
3. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
4. __growth__, [Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development
5. __flower__, [Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of putative topoisomerase 6 genes from rice confers stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  OsTOP6A1 was predominantly expressed in prepollinated flowers
6. __meiotic__, [Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Although AtSPO11-1, the homolog of OsTOP6A1 in Arabidopsis, has been implicated in meiotic recombination; the present study demonstrates possible additional role of OsTOP6A1 and provides an effective tool for engineering crop plants for tolerance to different environmental stresses,Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants
7. __meiosis__, [OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosomes pairing and crossover formation during meiosis in rice
8. __flower__, [Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The over expression of OsTOP6A1 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants driven by cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development
9. __abiotic stress__, ["Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants"%5BTitle%5D)), "Constitutive expression of a meiotic recombination protein gene homolog, OsTOP6A1, from rice confers abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants"
