## Key message
1. __jasmonic acid__, [Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  Extents of OsLS expression correlated with increases in flavin, jasmonic acid, and ethylene content, and correlated with increases in resistance levels, suggesting a role for OsLS in defense responses
2. __chloroplast__, [Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsLS protein localized to chloroplasts in three OsLS-expressing transgenic tobacco (LSETT) lines characterized as enhanced in growth and defense
3. __ethylene__, [Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of the rice lumazine synthase gene contributes to defense responses in transgenic tobacco%5BTitle%5D)),  Extents of OsLS expression correlated with increases in flavin, jasmonic acid, and ethylene content, and correlated with increases in resistance levels, suggesting a role for OsLS in defense responses
