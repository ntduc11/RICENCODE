## Key message
1. __photosynthesis__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions
2. __growth__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice
3. __leaf__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice
4. __nitrogen__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsLFNR1 affected the nitrogen assimilation pathway without inhibition of photosynthesis under normal conditions

## Connection
1. __OsLFNR1~LFNR1__, __OsLFNR2~LFNR2__, [Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of two isoforms of leaf-type ferredoxin-NADP(+)-oxidoreductase in rice using the heterologous expression system of Arabidopsis%5BTitle%5D)),  We found, by taking advantage of a gain-of-function approach, that expression of two rice (Oryza sativa) full-length cDNAs of leaf-type FNRs (OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2) led to altered chlorophyll fluorescence and growth in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice, We revealed that overexpression of the OsLFNR1 and OsLFNR2 full-length cDNAs resulted in distinct phenotypes despite the high sequence similarity between them, The endogenous protein level of OsLFNR was found to be suppressed in both OsLFNR1- and OsLFNR2-overexpressing rice plants, leading to changes in the stoichiometry of the two LFNR isoforms within the thylakoid and soluble fractions
