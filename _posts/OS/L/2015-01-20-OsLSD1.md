__RAPdb__: [Os08g0159500](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os08g0159500)  

## Publication
1. [OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation%5BTitle%5D)), 2005, Mol Plant Microbe Interact.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cell death__, [OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation%5BTitle%5D)), OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation
2. __flower__, [OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsLSD1, a rice zinc finger protein, regulates programmed cell death and callus differentiation%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsLSD1 driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter accelerated callus differentiation in transformed rice tissues and increased chlorophyll b content in transgenic rice plants

## Connection
1. __OsLSD1__, __OsLSD3__, [Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Stress-Responsive Expression, Subcellular Localization and Protein-Protein Interactions of the Rice Metacaspase Family.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMC1 interacted with OsLSD1 and OsLSD3 while OsMC3 only interacted with OsLSD1 and that the zinc finger domain in OsMC1 is responsible for the interaction activity
