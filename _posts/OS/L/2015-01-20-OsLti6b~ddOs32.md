## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Over-expression of OsLti6b increased cold tolerance as revealed by seedling wilting rates and ion leakages of mature leaves, demonstrating that the extent of the tolerance correlates well with its expression level
2. __reproductive__, [Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), Isolation of cold stress-responsive genes in the reproductive organs, and characterization of the OsLti6b gene from rice (Oryza sativa L.)
