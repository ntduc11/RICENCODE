1. __growth__, [The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The oscbt-1 mutant exhibits reduced levels of OsCBT transcripts and no significant morphological changes compared to wild-type plant although the growth of the mutant is stunted
2. __transcription factor__, [The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice
3. __defense response__, [The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice
4. __leaf__, [Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCBT was able to bind this sequence and activate beta-glucuronidase reporter gene expression driven by a minimal promoter containing tandem repeats of these sequences in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts
5. __defense__, [The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Taken together, the results support an idea that OsCBT might act as a negative regulator on plant defense,The calmodulin-binding transcription factor OsCBT suppresses defense responses to pathogens in rice"
6. __transcription factor__, [Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of a calmodulin-binding transcription factor from rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  This factor, which we have designated OsCBT (Oryza sativa CaM-binding transcription factor), has structural features similar to Arabidopsis AtSRs/AtCAMTAs and encodes a 103-kDa protein because it contains a CG-1 homology DNA-binding domain, three ankyrin repeats, a putative transcriptional activation domain, and five putative CaM-binding motifs
