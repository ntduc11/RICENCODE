3. __jasmonate__, [silencing COI1 in rice increases susceptibility to chewing insects and impairs inducible defense](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(silencing COI1 in rice increases susceptibility to chewing insects and impairs inducible defense%5BTitle%5D)),  In wild-type rice plants (WT), the transcripts of OsCOI1 were strongly and continuously up-regulated by LF infestation and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, but not by BPH infestation

## Connection
1. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ1~OsTIFY3~EG2__, [OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine, Furthermore, the OsJAZ1 protein was degraded by rice and Arabidopsis extracts in the presence of coronatine, and its degradation was inhibited by MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, suggesting 26S proteasome-mediated degradation of OsJAZ1 via the SCF(OsCOI1) complex
2. __OsbHLH148__, __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, [OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsbHLH148, a basic helix-loop-helix protein, interacts with OsJAZ proteins in a jasmonate signaling pathway leading to drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ1, a rice ZIM domain protein, interacted with OsbHLH148 in yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays, but it interacted with the putative OsCOI1 only in the presence of coronatine, Thus, our study suggests that OsbHLH148 acts on an initial response of jasmonate-regulated gene expression toward drought tolerance, constituting the OsbHLH148-OsJAZ-OsCOI1 signaling module in rice
3. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ8~OsTIFY10c__, [Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Involvement of OsJAZ8 in jasmonate-induced resistance to bacterial blight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ8 interacted with a putative OsCOI1, which is a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner
4. __OsCOI1b__, __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, [Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The Arabidopsis genome harbors a single COI gene, but the rice (Oryza sativa) genome harbors three COI homologs, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2
5. __OsCOI1b__, __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, [Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of Oryza sativa CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1b (OsCOI1b) delays leaf senescence.%5BTitle%5D)),  The Arabidopsis coi1-1 plants containing 35S:OsCOI1a or 35S:OsCOI1b rescued the delayed leaf senescence during dark incubation, suggesting that both OsCOI1a and OsCOI1b are required for promoting leaf senescence in rice
6. __OsCOI1~OsCOI1a__, __OsJAZ9~OsTIFY11a__, [OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ9 interacts with OsCOI1a, a component of the SCF(COI1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, in a coronatine-dependent manner, suggesting that OsJAZ9 is involved in the regulation of JA signaling
