## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Potential role of the rice OsCCS52A gene in endoreduplication%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice, OsCCS52A is highly expressed in seedlings, flowers, immature panicles and 15 DAP kernels
