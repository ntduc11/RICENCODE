## Key message
1. __root__, [A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input%5BTitle%5D)),  Although Oryza sativa CCaMK (OsCCaMK) is required for fungal accommodation in rice roots, little is known about the role of OsCCaMK in rice symbiosis with bacteria, Thus, CH4 oxidation and N2 fixation were simultaneously activated in the root zone of WT rice in the LN field and both processes are likely controlled by OsCCaMK
2. __defense__, [OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice%5BTitle%5D)), " In the present study, the role of rice CCaMK, OsDMI3, in ABA-induced antioxidant defense was investigated in leaves of rice (Oryza sativa) plants, Our data reveal that OsDMI3 is an important component in ABA-induced antioxidant defense in rice,OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice"
3. __ ABA __, [OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMI3-mediated activation of OsMPK1 regulates the activities of antioxidant enzymes in abscisic acid signalling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  ABA treatment induced the expression of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 and the activities of OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in rice leaves, Our data indicate that there exists a cross-talk between OsDMI3 and OsMPK1 in ABA signalling, in which OsDMI3 functions upstream of OsMPK1 to regulate the activities of antioxidant enzymes and the production of H2 O2 in rice
4. __oxidative__, [OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Further, the oxidative damage induced by higher concentrations of PEG and H(2)O(2) was aggravated in the mutant of OsDMI3"
5. __ethylene__, [OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Treatments with ABA, H(2)O(2), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) induced the expression of OsDMI3 and the activity of OsDMI3, and H(2)O(2) is required for the ABA-induced increases in the expression and the activity of OsDMI3 under water stress
6. __nitrogen__, [A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice gene for microbial symbiosis, Oryza sativa CCaMK, reduces CH4 flux in a paddy field with low nitrogen input%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the effect of a Tos17-induced OsCCaMK mutant (NE1115) on CH4 flux in low-nitrogen (LN) and standard-nitrogen (SN) paddy fields compared with wild-type (WT) Nipponbare
7. __ ABA __, [OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsDMI3 is a novel component of abscisic acid signaling in the induction of antioxidant defense in leaves of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, the analysis of the RNAi silencing of OsDMI3 in protoplasts and the mutant of OsDMI3 showed that higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation require OsDMI3 activation in ABA signaling, but the initial H(2)O(2) production induced by ABA is not dependent on the activation of OsDMI3 in leaves of rice plants

2. __CYCLOPS~OsIPD3__, __OsCCaMK~OsDMI3__, [CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CYCLOPS, a mediator of symbiotic intracellular accommodation%5BTitle%5D)),  This arrest was overcome when a deregulated CCaMK mutant version was introduced into cyclops mutants, conferring the development of full-sized, spontaneous nodules, Because cyclops mutants block symbiotic infection but are competent for nodule development, they reveal a bifurcation of signal transduction downstream of CCaMK, We observed colocalization and physical interaction between CCaMK and CYCLOPS in plant and yeast cell nuclei in the absence of symbiotic stimulation, Importantly, CYCLOPS is a phosphorylation substrate of CCaMK in vitro, Our results suggest that CYCLOPS forms an ancient, preassembled signal transduction complex with CCaMK that is specifically required for infection, whereas organogenesis likely requires additional yet-to-be identified CCaMK interactors or substrates
