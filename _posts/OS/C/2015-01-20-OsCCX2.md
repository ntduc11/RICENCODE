## Key message
1. __tolerance__, [A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast to AtCCXs, OsCCX2 expressing K667 yeast cells show tolerance towards excess Na(+), Li(+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Co(2+) and suggest its ability to transport both mono as well as divalent cations in yeast
2. __tolerance__, [A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCCX2 can be used as potential candidate for enhancing the abiotic stress tolerance in plants as well as for phytoremediation of heavy metal polluted soil
3. __abiotic stress__, [A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice tonoplastic calcium exchanger, OsCCX2 mediates Ca(2+)/cation transport in yeast.%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice genome encode four CCXs and only OsCCX2 transcript showed differential expression under abiotic stresses and Ca(2+) starvation conditions
