## Expression information

## Key message
1. __plasma membrane__, [C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
2. __nucleus__, [C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsCML3 was mainly localized in the plasma membrane, whereas OsCML3m was found in the nucleus
3. __nucleus__, [C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein.%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, OsCML3 probably provides a mechanism for manipulating the DNA-binding ability of OsHMGB1 in the nucleus and its C-terminal extension provides an intracellular Ca(2+) regulatory switch

## Connection
1. __HMGB1~OsHMGB1__, __OsCML3__, [C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(C-terminal extension of calmodulin-like 3 protein from Oryza sativa L.: interaction with a high mobility group target protein%5BTitle%5D)), The rice high mobility group B1 (OsHMGB1) protein was identified as one of the putative OsCML3 target proteins
