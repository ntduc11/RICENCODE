## Expression information
__Expression__: Ethylene induces MHZ5 expression, the production of neoxanthin, an ABA biosynthesis precursor, and ABA accumulation in roots |  MHZ5 overexpression results in enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots and reduced ethylene sensitivity in coleoptiles |  Mutation or overexpression of MHZ5 also alters the expression of ethylene-responsive genes  
__OverExpression__: MHZ5 overexpression results in enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots and reduced ethylene sensitivity in coleoptiles |  Mutation or overexpression of MHZ5 also alters the expression of ethylene-responsive genes  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __oxidative__, [Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutations of genes in synthesis of the carotenoid precursors of ABA lead to pre-harvest sprouting and photo-oxidation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " The greatly increased activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, and reduced photosystem (PS) II core proteins CP43, CP47 and D1 in leaves of the Oscrtiso/phs3-1mutant and OsLCY RNAi transgenic rice indicated that photo-oxidative damage occurred in PS II, consistent with the accumulation of ROS in these plants"
2. __photosynthesis__, [ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA2, encoding a carotenoid isomerase, is involved in photoprotection in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression analysis via both RT-PCR and ZEBRA2-promoter-beta-glucuronidase (GUS) transgenic rice indicates that ZEBRA2 is predominantly expressed in mesophyll cells of mature leaves where active photosynthesis occurs
