## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we report that OsCPK4 expression is induced by high salinity, drought, and the phytohormone abscisic acid |  Moreover, a plasma membrane localization of OsCPK4 was observed by transient expression assays of green fluorescent protein-tagged OsCPK4 in onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells |  Overexpression of OsCPK4 in rice plants significantly enhances tolerance to salt and drought stress |  We carried out microarray analysis of transgenic rice overexpressing OsCPK4 and found that overexpression of OsCPK4 has a low impact on the rice transcriptome |  Meanwhile, OsCPK4 overexpression has no effect on the expression of well-characterized abiotic stress-associated transcriptional regulatory networks (i
