## Key message
1. __homeostasis__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1%5BTitle%5D)),  Results from different tests indicated that the OsCCC1 plays a significant role in K+ and Cl- homeostasis and rice plant development
2. __leaf__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
3. __root__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
4. __shoot__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1%5BTitle%5D)),  sativa cDNA, which was named OsCCC1, can be induced by KCl in the shoot and root and that the expression level was higher in the leaf and root tips than in any other part of the rice plant
5. __transporter__, [Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1%5BTitle%5D)), Cloning and functional characterization of a cation-chloride cotransporter gene OsCCC1
