## Key message
1. __anther development__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
2. __pollen__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
3. __anther__, [Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system%5BTitle%5D)),  GUS assay with the T-DNA tagged line indicated that the OsCP1 promoter was highly active in the rice anther
4. __anther__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
5. __fertility__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought
6. __pollen__, [Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterization of a rice cysteine protease gene, OSCP1, using T-DNA gene-trap system%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, the results demonstrated that OsCP1 is a cysteine protease gene that might play an important role in pollen development
7. __drought__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)), " Moreover, overexpression of OsDIL lessened the down-regulation by drought of anther developmental genes (OsC4, CYP704B2 and OsCP1), providing a mechanism supporting pollen fertility under drought"

5. __OsCP1__, __TDR__, [The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice tapetum degeneration retardation gene is required for tapetum degradation and anther development%5BTitle%5D)),  More importantly, two genes, Os CP1 and Os c6, encoding a Cys protease and a protease inhibitor, respectively, were shown to be the likely direct targets of TDR through chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
