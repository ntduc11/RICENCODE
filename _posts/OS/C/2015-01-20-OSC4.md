## Key message
1. __root__, [Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage%5BTitle%5D)),  By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots
2. __anther__, [Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum%5BTitle%5D)), In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage
3. __pollen__, [Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation
4. __microspore__, [Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of rice genes specifically expressed in the anther tapetum%5BTitle%5D)), In situ localization of mRNA was carried out on two cDNAs (Osc4 and Osc6) that had been isolated from rice anthers at the microspore stage
5. __anther__, [Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation of genes abundantly expressed in rice anthers at the microspore stage%5BTitle%5D)),  By differential screening of the library, we have isolated cDNAs of two genes, designated as Osc4 and Osc6, that are abundantly expressed in anthers containing tetrads and uninucleate microspores, but are not expressed in leaves or roots, Expression of Osc4 is absent in mature anthers, while Osc6 is present although the expression decays during pollen maturation

## Connection
1. __OSC4__, __OsHUB1~MIP1__, [Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Histone H2B Monoubiquitination Mediated by OsHUB1 and OsHUB2 Is Involved in Anther Development by Regulating Tapetum Degradation Related Genes in Rice%5BTitle%5D)), Anther transcriptome analysis revealed that several key tapetum degradation-related genes including OsC4, OsCP1 and UDT1 were down-regulated in the mutants.
