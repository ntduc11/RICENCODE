## Key message
1. __oxidative stress__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity
2. __salinity__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP21-4 exhibited increased tolerance to salinity and hydrogen peroxide treatment, along with increased peroxidase activity
3. __tolerance__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, transgenic plants overexpressing OsCYP21-4 exhibited increased tolerance to salinity and hydrogen peroxide treatment, along with increased peroxidase activity
4. __oxidative__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity
5. __abiotic stress__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness
6. __stress__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity
7. __phytohormone__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness
8. __abscisic acid__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness
9. __stress tolerance__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  These results demonstrate that OsCYP21-4 is a novel Golgi-localized cyclophilin that plays a role in oxidative stress tolerance, possibly by regulating peroxidase activity
10. __biotic stress__, [OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsCYP21-4, a novel Golgi-resident cyclophilin, increases oxidative stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsCYP21-4 transcript levels increased in response to treatments with various abiotic stresses and the phytohormone abscisic acid, revealing its stress-responsiveness
