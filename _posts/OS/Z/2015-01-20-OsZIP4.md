## Expression information

## Key message
1. __meristem__, [OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots
2. __flower__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the OsZIP4 gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter were produced
3. __seed__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The Zn concentration in seeds of 35S-OsZIP4 plants was four times lower compared with vector controls
4. __shoot__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots, Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls, Microarray analysis revealed that the genes expressed in shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants coincided with those induced in shoots of Zn-deficient plants
5. __root__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  The Zn concentration in roots of 35S-OsZIP4 transgenic plants was 10 times higher than in those of vector controls, but it was five times lower in shoots, Northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed transcripts of OsZIP4 expression driven by the CaMV 35S promoter in roots and shoots of 35S-OsZIP4 plants, but levels of endogenous OsZIP4 transcripts were low in roots and high in shoots compared with vector controls
6. __root__, [OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray and northern blot analysis revealed that OsZIP4 was highly expressed under conditions of Zn deficiency in roots and shoots, Real-time-PCR revealed that the OsZIP4 transcripts were more abundant than those of OsZIP1 or OsZIP3 in Zn-deficient roots and shoots, In situ hybridization analysis revealed that OsZIP4 in Zn-deficient rice was expressed in shoots and roots, especially in phloem cells, Furthermore, OsZIP4 transcripts were detected in the meristem of Zn-deficient roots and shoots
7. __zinc__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants
8. __transporter__, [Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants%5BTitle%5D)),  OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that localizes to apical cells, These results indicate that constitutive expression of OsZIP4 changes the Zn distribution within rice plants, and that OsZIP4 is a critical Zn transporter that must be strictly regulated,Overexpression of the OsZIP4 zinc transporter confers disarrangement of zinc distribution in rice plants
9. __transporter__, [OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Four distinct genes, OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP6, and OsZIP7 that exhibit sequence similarity to the rice ferrous ion transporter, OsIRT1, were isolated, OsZIP4 complemented a Zn-uptake-deficient yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutant, Deltazrt1,Deltazrt2, indicating that OsZIP4 is a functional transporter of Zn, These results suggested that OsZIP4 is a Zn transporter that may be responsible for the translocation of Zn within rice plants,OsZIP4, a novel zinc-regulated zinc transporter in rice
