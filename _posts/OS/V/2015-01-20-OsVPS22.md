## Key message
1. __grain filling__, [Knockout of the VPS22 component of the ESCRT-II complex in rice (Oryza sativa L.) causes chalky endosperm and early seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockout of the VPS22 component of the ESCRT-II complex in rice (Oryza sativa L.) causes chalky endosperm and early seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D)),  In summary, our data suggest that OsVPS22 may be required for seedling viability and grain filling in rice, thus providing a valuable resource for further exploration of the functions of the ESCRTing machinery in plants
