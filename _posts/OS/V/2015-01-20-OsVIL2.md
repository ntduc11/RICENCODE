## Key message

2. __heading date__, [LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a
3. __flower__, [OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Insertion mutations in OsVIL2 caused late flowering under both long and short days, As observed from osvil2, a null mutation of OsEMF2b caused late flowering by increasing OsLFL1 expression and decreasing Ehd1 expression, Thus, we conclude that OsVIL2 functions together with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1,OsVIL2 functions with PRC2 to induce flowering by repressing OsLFL1 in rice
