## Key message
1. __flower__, [Activation of gibberellin 2-oxidase 6 decreases active gibberellin levels and creates a dominant semi-dwarf phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of gibberellin 2-oxidase 6 decreases active gibberellin levels and creates a dominant semi-dwarf phenotype in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  Unlike the over-expression of OsGA2ox1, which led to a high rate of seed abortion, the H032 mutant retained normal flowering and seed production
2. __stem__, [Expression of a Gibberellin 2-Oxidase Gene around the Shoot Apex Is Related to Phase Transition in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a Gibberellin 2-Oxidase Gene around the Shoot Apex Is Related to Phase Transition in Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic expression of theOsGA2ox1 cDNA in transgenic rice inhibited stem elongation and the development of reproductive organs, OsGA2ox1was expressed in shoot apex and roots but not in leaves and stems, These observations suggest that OsGA2ox1 controls the level of bioactive GAs in the shoot apical meristem; therefore, reduction in its expression may contribute to the early development of the inflorescence meristem
3. __meristem__, [Expression of a Gibberellin 2-Oxidase Gene around the Shoot Apex Is Related to Phase Transition in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression of a Gibberellin 2-Oxidase Gene around the Shoot Apex Is Related to Phase Transition in Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These observations suggest that OsGA2ox1 controls the level of bioactive GAs in the shoot apical meristem; therefore, reduction in its expression may contribute to the early development of the inflorescence meristem
