## Information
__Symbol__: OsGRF3  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os04g51190](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g51190)  
__RAPdb__: [Os04g0600900](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os04g0600900)  

## Publication
1. [Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: ProOskn2:Î²-glucuronidase reporter expression was down-regulated by OsGRF3 and OsGRF10 in vivo, suggesting that these proteins function as transcriptional repressors |  These effects were associated with down-regulation of endogenous Oskn2 expression by OsGRF3  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:

## Connection
1. __OsGRF3__, __OSH71~Oskn2__, [Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D)),  A yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) one-hybrid screen with the upstream sequence of the KNOX gene Oskn2 from rice (Oryza sativa) resulted in isolation of OsGRF3 and OsGRF10
