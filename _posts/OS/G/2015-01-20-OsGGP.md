## Key message
1. __growth__, [Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  All plants except for KO mutants of OsGGP showed distinct peaks in foliar AsA concentrations during the growth, which were consistent with up-regulation of OsGGP, suggesting that OsGGP plays a pivotal role in regulating foliar AsA levels during different growth stages
2. __biomass__, [Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Mutants showed lower biomass production than their wild-types, especially when OsGGP was lacking (around 80 % reductions)

## Connection
1. __OsGGP__, __OsMIOX__, [Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ascorbate biosynthesis and its involvement in stress tolerance and plant development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  KO of two isoforms of GDP-D-mannose epimerase (OsGME) reduced the foliar AsA level by 20-30 %, and KO of GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (OsGGP) by 80 %, while KO of myo-inositol oxygenase (OsMIOX) did not affect foliar AsA levels
