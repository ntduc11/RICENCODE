## Key message
1. __drought__, [Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane%5BTitle%5D)), " Compared to the wild-type, the osgl1-1 mutant showed decreased cuticular wax deposition, thinner cuticular membrane, decreased chlorophyll leaching, increased rate of water loss, and enhanced sensitivity to drought"
2. __leaf__, [Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane%5BTitle%5D)),  In the present study, we characterized a rice leaf wax-deficient mutant osgl1-1 derived from a spontaneous mutation, which exhibited a wax-deficient and highly hydrophilic leaf phenotype,Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane
3. __cuticle__, [Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane%5BTitle%5D)), Rice OsGL1-1 is involved in leaf cuticular wax and cuticle membrane
