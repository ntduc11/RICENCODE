## Key message
1. __anther__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We isolated a cDNA for β-1,3-glucanase from rice anther and named it Oryza sativa glucanase 1 (Osg1), RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
2. __leaf__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
3. __sheath__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Osg1 was found to be expressed throughout the plant and highly expressed in florets, leaf sheaths, and leaf blades
4. __anther__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
5. __root__, [Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Novel β-1,3-Glucanase Gene from Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR analysis revealed that Osg1 transcripts were present in leaves, roots, and anthers
6. __microspore__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets, The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage
7. __sterility__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The silencing of Osg1 resulted in male sterility
8. __pollen__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen mother cells appeared to be normal in Osg1-RI plants, but callose degradation was disrupted around the microspores in the anther locules of the Osg1-RI plants at the early microspore stage,A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development
9. __meiosis__, [A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice beta-1,3-glucanase gene Osg1 is required for callose degradation in pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  Investigations using real-time PCR, immunocytochemical analysis, and a GUS-reporter gene driven by the Osg1 promoter indicated that Osg1 was mainly expressed at the late meiosis, early microspore, and middle microspore stages in the florets
