## Key message
1. __potassium__, [Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the characterization of two inward rectifying shaker-like potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in guard cell of rice plants, While OsKAT2 showed typical potassium channel activity, like that of Arabidopsis KAT1, OsKAT3 did not despite high sequence similarity between the two channel proteins, Interestingly, the two potassium channels physically interacted with each other and such interaction negatively regulated the OsKAT2 channel activity in CHO cell system,Unique features of two potassium channels, OsKAT2 and OsKAT3, expressed in rice guard cells
