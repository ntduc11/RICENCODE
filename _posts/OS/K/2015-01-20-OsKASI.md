## Key message
1. __root__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)), The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice
2. __root__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice
3. __map-based cloning__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI
4. __fertility__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, OsKASI deficiency resulted in reduced fertility and a remarkable change in fatty acid (FA) composition and contents in roots and seeds
5. __development__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)), The involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is found to play a critical role in root development of rice
6. __development__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that involvement of OsKASI in FA synthesis is required for root development in rice

9. __R protein__, [OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsKASI, a β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I, is involved in root development in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that the mutation occurred in a putative 3-oxoacyl-synthase, an ortholog of β-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase I (KASI) in Arabidopsis, thus designated as OsKASI
