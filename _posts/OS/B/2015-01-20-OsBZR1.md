2. __ILI1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1, Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1
3. __LIC~OsLIC1__, __OsBZR1__, [Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Dynamics of brassinosteroid response modulated by negative regulator LIC in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that Oryza sativa LEAF and TILLER ANGLE INCREASED CONTROLLER (LIC) acts as an antagonistic transcription factor of BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) to attenuate the BR signaling pathway, The gain-of-function mutant lic-1 and LIC-overexpressing lines showed erect leaves, similar to BZR1-depleted lines, which indicates the opposite roles of LIC and BZR1 in regulating leaf bending, For negative feedback, LIC bound to the core element CTCGC in the BZR1 promoter on gel-shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and repressed its transcription on transient transformation assay, LIC directly regulated target genes such as INCREASED LEAF INCLINATION 1 (ILI1) to oppose the action of BZR1, Repression of LIC in ILI1 transcription in protoplasts was partially rescued by BZR1, Phenotypic analysis of the crossed lines depleted in both LIC and BZR1 suggested that BZR1 functionally depends on LIC, Molecular and physiology assays revealed that LIC plays a dominant role at high BR levels, whereas BZR1 is dominant at low levels, Thus, LIC regulates rice leaf bending as an antagonistic transcription factor of BZR1
4. __CSA__, __OsBZR1__, [Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Brassinosteroids Promote Development of Rice Pollen Grains and Seeds by Triggering Expression of CSA, a MYB Domain Protein.%5BTitle%5D)),  Mechanically, OsBZR1 directly promotes CSA expression and CSA directly triggers expression of sugar partitioning and metabolic genes during pollen and seed development
