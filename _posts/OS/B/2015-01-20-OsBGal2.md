## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
2. __root__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
3. __panicle__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The genes encoding two isoforms of β-galactosidase expressed in germinating rice and panicle, designated OsBGal1 and OsBGal2, were cloned and sequenced, The related OsBGal2 clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues
4. __shoot__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
5. __sheath__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
6. __leaf__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The two genes were found to be relatively highly expressed in seedling roots and shoots and in leaf sheath in 15~30-day-old plants, which contained major immunoreactive proteins of approximately 90 kDa for OsBGal1 protein and 55 kDa for OsBGal2 in extracts of these tissues
7. __flower__, [Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of β-galactosidases from germinating rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The related OsBGal2 clone from panicle at flowering stage encodes 715 amino acid residues, including a signal peptide of 20 residues, Both were also expressed at low levels in flowers and immature seeds, but only the OsBGal2 transcript was found in mature seeds
