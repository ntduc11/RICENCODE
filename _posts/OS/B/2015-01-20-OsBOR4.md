## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative PCR analysis and OsBOR4 promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion revealed that OsBOR4 was both highly and specifically expressed in pollen, The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants, Pollen from osbor4 homozygous plants elongated fewer tubes on wild-type stigmas, and tube elongation of mutant pollen was less efficient compared with the wild-type pollen, suggesting reduced competence of osbor4 mutant pollen, The reduced competence of mutant pollen was further supported by the crosses of independent Tos17-inserted alleles of OsBOR4, Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation,Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process
2. __floral__, [Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process%5BTitle%5D)),  The pollen grains were viable and development of floral organs was normal in the homozygous osbor4 mutants
3. __transporter__, [Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBOR4 is an active efflux transporter of B, Our results suggest that OsBOR4, a boron efflux transporter, is required for normal pollen germination and/or tube elongation,Roles of pollen-specific boron efflux transporter, OsBOR4, in the rice fertilization process
