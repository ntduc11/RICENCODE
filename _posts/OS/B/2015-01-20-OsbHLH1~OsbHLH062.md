4. __cold stress__, [A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response%5BTitle%5D)), A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response
5. __transcription factor__, [A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that the OsbHLH1 may function as a transcription factor in a cold signal-transduction pathway,A rice transcription factor OsbHLH1 is involved in cold stress response
6. __transcription factor__, [OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJAZ9 interacts with several bHLH transcription factors including OsbHLH062 via the Jas domain
7. __transporter__, [OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsJAZ9 acts as a transcriptional regulator in jasmonate signaling and modulates salt stress tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsbHLH062 can bind to an E-box in the promoters of the ion transporter genes such as OsHAK21, and most of these ion transporter genes are responsive to JA treatment
