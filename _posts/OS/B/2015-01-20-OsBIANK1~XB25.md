## Connection
1. __OsBIANK1~XB25__, __xa21__, [The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here that XA21 binding protein 25 (XB25) belongs to the plant-specific ankyrin-repeat (PANK) family, XB25 physically interacts, in vitro, with the transmembrane domain of XA21 through its N-terminal binding to transmembrane and positively charged domain (BTMP) repeats, In addition, XB25 associates with XA21 in planta, The downregulation of Xb25 results in reduced levels of XA21 and compromised XA21-mediated disease resistance at the adult stage, Taken together, these results indicate that XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance,The XA21 binding protein XB25 is required for maintaining XA21-mediated disease resistance
