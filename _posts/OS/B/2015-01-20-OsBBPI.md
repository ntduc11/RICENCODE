## Expression information

## Key message
1. __jasmonic__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
2. __seedling__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
3. __salicylic acid__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  However, a simultaneous application of salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA), with JA, respectively, completely blocked OsBBPI gene expression, whereas kinetin (KN) was only partially effective
4. __leaf__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBBPI was found to be rapidly induced in rice seedling leaf in response to cut, exogenous jasmonic acid (JA), and two potent protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitors, cantharidin (CN) and endothall (EN), in a light/dark-, time- and dose-dependent manner; this induction was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), indicating a requirement for de novo protein synthesis in its induction
5. __ ja __, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.)

Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
6. __phytohormone__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.)

7. __ethylene__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  Besides JA, it was found that the ethylene generator ethephon (ET) also had an enhancing effect on OsBBPI transcript, suggesting a direct effect of ethylene on OsBBPI expression, Taken together, these results suggest that among the phytohormones tested here, JA and ethylene play important role(s) in regulating OsBBPI expression, with an intimate interaction with light signals
8. __ ABA __, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors%5BTitle%5D)),  To the best of our knowledge, complete inhibition of JA-induced OsBBPI expression by SA is the first report in monocots, and with ABA in plants
9. __jasmonic acid__, [Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) Bowman–Birk proteinase inhibitor: tightly light regulated induction in response to cut, jasmonic acid, ethylene and protein phosphatase 2A inhibitors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa L.)
