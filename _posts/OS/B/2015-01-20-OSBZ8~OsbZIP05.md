## Expression information

## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars%5BTitle%5D)),  The current communication shows a comparative analysis performed on the binding of rice nuclear proteins, together with the purified transcription factor OSBZ8, to the cis-elements in the promoters of Rab16A (Motif I/Motif II), Osem (Motif A-1/Motif B) and Em (4X ABRE/2X ABRC)
2. __seedling__, [An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Treatment of the seedlings with NaCl was found to enhance the complex formation, suggesting the regulation of OSBZ8 gene at both transcriptional and post-translational steps
3. __lamina__, [An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of OSBZ8 (OSBZ8p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1
4. __ ABA __, [A rice bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, is rapidly induced by abscisic acid](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice bZIP protein, designated OSBZ8, is rapidly induced by abscisic acid%5BTitle%5D)),  The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA was induced by treatment with ABA of imbibed mature rice embryos, of young plant tissues and of suspension-cultured cells, The accumulation of OSBZ8 mRNA in response to ABA preceded that of Osem and Rab16A mRNAs and was not inhibited by an inhibitor of protein synthesis, cycloheximide, These results strongly suggest that OSBZ8 might be involved in the regulation of transcription by ABA in rice
5. __vegetative__, [Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars%5BTitle%5D)), Trans-acting factor designated OSBZ8 interacts with both typical abscisic acid responsive elements as well as abscisic acid responsive element-like sequences in the vegetative tissues of indica rice cultivars

7. __vegetative__, [An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Still, nothing is known about the expression of OSBZ8 at protein level in vegetative tissue of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice plants, Therefore, OSBZ8 was considered to play an important role in the regulation of transcription in the vegetative tissue of rice, The aim of this study is to find out whether OSBZ8 has any role in regulating the NaCl-stress induced gene expression in vegetative tissue and whether the expression of OSBZ8 factor directly correlates with the stress tolerance of different varieties of indica type rice
8. __salt tolerance__, ["An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  Comparative EMSA with different varieties of rice suggests a positive correlation with the expression pattern of OSBZ8 and salt tolerance in rice cultivars
9. __salt__, ["An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice"%5BTitle%5D)), " Still, nothing is known about the expression of OSBZ8 at protein level in vegetative tissue of salt sensitive and salt tolerant rice plants, RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of OSBZ8 (OSBZ8p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1, Comparative EMSA with different varieties of rice suggests a positive correlation with the expression pattern of OSBZ8 and salt tolerance in rice cultivars,An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice"

11. __root__, [An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ABRE-binding factor, OSBZ8, is highly expressed in salt tolerant cultivars than in salt sensitive cultivars of indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RESULTS: Northern analysis of total RNA from roots and lamina of salt-sensitive M-I-48 and salt-tolerant Nonabokra, when probed with the N-terminal unique region of OSBZ8 (OSBZ8p, without the highly conserved basic region), a transcript of 1
