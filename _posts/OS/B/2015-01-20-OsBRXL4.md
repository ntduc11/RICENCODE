## Expression information

## Key message
1. __auxin__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively, The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
2. __root__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
3. __growth__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
4. __primary root__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsBRXL4-overexpression plant showed significantly longer root and increased sensitivity to auxin than wild type, suggesting that OsBRXL4 may be involved in primary root growth through the auxin signaling pathway
5. __brassinosteroid__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBRXL1 and OsBRXL4 were significantly up-regulated by brassinosteroid and auxin, respectively
6. __panicle__, [Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Systematic identification and expression analysis of BREVIS RADIX-like homologous genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Four rice BRX-like genes were predominantly (OsBRXL1, OsBRXL2, and OsBRXL4) or specifically (OsBRXL3) expressed in young panicle
