2. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE1 expressed mainly in active tissues such as vascular bundles and root primordial
3. __lamina__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of a novel brassinolide enhanced gene OsBLE1 in Oryza sativa seedlings%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBLE1 expression was most responsive to BL in lamina joint in rice seedlings; besides, IAA and GA3 also enhanced its expression
