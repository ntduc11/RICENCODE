## Key message
1. __leaf__, [OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
2. __growth__, [OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic interference of OsBP-73 gene expression by double-stranded RNA strikingly inhibits the whole plant growth but does not affect the passage from the juvenile to adult phase,OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth
3. __seed__, [OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBP-73, a rice gene, encodes a novel DNA-binding protein with a SAP-like domain and its genetic interference by double-stranded RNA inhibits rice growth%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis demonstrated that OsBP-73 is weakly expressed in root, leaf and immature seed
