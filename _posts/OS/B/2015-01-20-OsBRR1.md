## Key message
1. __growth__, [A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54-04) and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment
2. __blast__, [A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, RNA interference (RNAi) strategy was used to specifically knockdown 59 individual rice genes encoding putative LRR-RLKs, and a novel rice blast resistance-related gene (designated as OsBRR1) was identified by screening T(0) RNAi population using a weakly virulent isolate of Magnaporthe oryzae, Ken 54-04, OsBRR1 expression was low in leaves and undetectable in roots under normal growth conditions, while its transcript was significantly induced in leaves infected with the blast fungus (Ken 54-04) and was moderately affected by ABA, JA and SA treatment, These results indicate that OsBRR1 is involved in rice resistance responses to blast fungus and mediates resistance to rice blast,A putative leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase, OsBRR1, is involved in rice blast resistance
