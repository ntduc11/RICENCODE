## Key message
1. __disease resistance__, [Overexpression in transgenic tobacco reveals different roles for the rice homeodomain gene OsBIHD1 in biotic and abiotic stress responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression in transgenic tobacco reveals different roles for the rice homeodomain gene OsBIHD1 in biotic and abiotic stress responses%5BTitle%5D)),  To allow a better understanding of the function of OsBIHD1 in plant disease resistance response, the OsBIHD1 gene in tobacco was overexpressed by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation with a construct containing the OsBIHD1 ORF under control of the 35S promoter, The results suggested that the OsBIHD1 protein may be positively involved in activating expression of the defence-related genes in disease resistance responses, and is also important in rice development and abiotic stress tolerance
2. __disease__, [Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Northern blot analysis showed that expression of OsBIHD1 was activated upon treatment with benzothiadiazole (BTH), which is capable of inducing disease resistance,Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses
3. __transcription factor__, [Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Up-regulation of OsBIHD1, a rice gene encoding BELL homeodomain transcriptional factor, in disease resistance responses%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsBIHD1 is a BELL type of homeodomain transcription factor present in the nucleus, whose induction is associated with resistance response in rice
