## Key message
1. __salt stress__, ["A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress
2. __transporter__, [A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsMYB2 enhanced up-regulation of genes encoding proline synthase and transporters
3. __abiotic stress__, ["A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"%5BTitle%5D)), " This study isolated a rice R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, and functionally characterized its role in tolerance to abiotic stress by generating transgenic rice plants with overexpressing and RNA interference OsMYB2"
4. __growth__, [A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants
5. __transcription factor__, [A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress
6. __salt__, ["A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of OsMYB2 was up-regulated by salt, cold, and dehydration stress, No difference in growth and development between the OsMYB2-overexpressing and wild-type plants was observed under normal growth conditions, but the OsMYB2-overexpressing plants were more tolerant to salt, cold, and dehydration stresses and more sensitive to abscisic acid than wild-type plants, The OsMYB2-overexpressing plants accumulated greater amounts of soluble sugars and proline than wild-type plants under salt stress, These findings suggest that OsMYB2 encodes a stress-responsive MYB transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in tolerance of rice to salt, cold, and dehydration stress,A R2R3-type MYB gene, OsMYB2, is involved in salt, cold, and dehydration tolerance in rice"
