## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots
2. __jasmonate__, [Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants
3. __root__, [Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcript levels of OsMADS26 were increased in an age-dependent manner in the shoots and roots
4. __ethylene__, [Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Further characterization of a rice AGL12 group MADS-box gene, OsMADS26%5BTitle%5D)),  Microarray analyses using this inducible system showed that biosynthesis genes for jasmonate, ethylene, and reactive oxygen species, as well as putative downstream targets involved in the stress-related process, were up-regulated in OsMADS26-overexpressing plants
