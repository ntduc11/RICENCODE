## Key message
1. __flower__, [OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a%5BTitle%5D)),  In SDs OsMADS51 null mutants flowered 2 weeks later than normal, whereas in long days loss of OsMADS51 had little effect on flowering, Ectopic expression of OsMADS51 caused flowering to occur about 7 d earlier only in SDs, These results indicate that OsMADS51 is a flowering promoter, particularly in SDs, and that this gene functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a, In summary, OsMADS51 is a novel flowering promoter that transmits a SD promotion signal from OsGI to Ehd1,OsMADS51 is a short-day flowering promoter that functions upstream of Ehd1, OsMADS14, and Hd3a
