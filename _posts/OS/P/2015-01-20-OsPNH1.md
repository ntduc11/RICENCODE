## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Around the SAM, OsPNH1 was strongly expressed in developing leaf primordia, specifically in the presumptive vascular domains, developing vascular tissues, a few cell-layers of the adaxial region, and future bundle sheath extension cells, On the basis of these observations, we propose that OsPNH1 functions not only in SAM maintenance as previously thought, but also in leaf formation through vascular development,OsPNH1regulates leaf development and maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in rice

## Connection
1. __FCP1~OsCLE402__, __OsPNH1__, [Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice leaf development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression analysis suggests that FON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 is involved in rice leaf development.%5BTitle%5D)),  By contrast, OsPNH1, which is expressed in provascular and developing vascular tissues in normal seedlings, was strongly repressed by FCP1 overexpression
