## Key message
1. __pollen__, [Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice
2. __flower__, [Overexpression of the OsPDCD5 gene induces programmed cell death in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of the OsPDCD5 gene induces programmed cell death in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive expression of OsPDCD5 from the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter induced programmed cell death (PCD) in transgenic rice
3. __sterility__, [Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report that decreased expression of OsPDCD5 caused by antisense technology could induce pollen sterility in photoperiod-sensitive rice,Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice
4. __fertility__, [Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In F1 hybrids made from transgenic plants with antisense-OsPDCD5 and japonica rice varieties, lower transcript inhibition could restore fertility, under certain photoperiod and temperatures
5. __temperature__, [Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " In F1 hybrids made from transgenic plants with antisense-OsPDCD5 and japonica rice varieties, lower transcript inhibition could restore fertility, under certain photoperiod and temperatures"
6. __cell death__, [Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Down-regulation of the OsPDCD5 gene induced photoperiod-sensitive male sterility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDCD5, is an ortholog to mammalian programmed cell death 5 gene
