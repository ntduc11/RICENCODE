## Publication
1. [OsPIN5b modulates rice plant architecture and yield by changing auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsPIN5b modulates rice plant architecture and yield by changing auxin homeostasis, transport and distribution.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant J.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Over-expression of the auxin efflux carrier-like gene OsPIN5b causes pleiotropic effects, mainly reducing plant height, leaf and tiller number, shoot and root biomass, seed setting rate, panicle length and yield parameters |  Conversely, reduced expression of OsPIN5b results in higher tiller number, more vigorous root system, longer panicles and increased yield  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
