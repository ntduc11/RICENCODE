## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined
2. __growth__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development
3. __leaf__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined, Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h, The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
4. __sheath__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was expressed in leaf blade and leaf sheath but not in callus and root, while OsPDK2 was expressed constitutively in all tissues examined, Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h, The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
5. __seed__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h, The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by a 2,067 bp OsPDK1 promoter region fragment, was mainly expressed in the aleurone layer of germinating seed and leaf sheath
6. __gibberellin__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDK1 was identified as a gibberellin-up-regulated gene using a cDNA microarray, These results suggest that gibberellin modulates the activity of mtPDC by regulating OsPDK1 expression and subsequently controlling plant growth and development
7. __seedling__, [Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin regulates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Maximum expression of OsPDK1 in leaf sheath was detected by Northern blot analysis when seedlings were treated with 5 microM GA3 for 24 h
