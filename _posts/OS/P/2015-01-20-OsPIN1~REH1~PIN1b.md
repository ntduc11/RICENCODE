2. __OsPIN1~REH1~PIN1b__, __RFL~APO2__, [Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functions for rice RFL in vegetative axillary meristem specification and outgrowth.%5BTitle%5D)),  These modified forms of RFL had only indirect effects on OsPIN1
3. __IAA6~OsIAA6__, __OsPIN1~REH1~PIN1b__, [OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsIAA6, a member of the rice Aux/IAA gene family, is involved in drought tolerance and tiller outgrowth.%5BTitle%5D)),  A knock-down mutant of OsIAA6 showed abnormal tiller outgrowth, apparently due to the regulation of the auxin transporter OsPIN1 and the rice tillering inhibitor OsTB1
