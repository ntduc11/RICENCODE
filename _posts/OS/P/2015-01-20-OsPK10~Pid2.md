## Connection
1. __OsPK10~Pid2__, __OsPUB15__, [The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.%5BTitle%5D)), The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.
2. __OsPK10~Pid2__, __OsPUB15__, [The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that OsPUB15 physically interacted with the kinase domain of PID2 (PID2K) in vitro and in vivo and the ARM repeat domain of OsPUB15 was essential for the interaction
3. __OsPK10~Pid2__, __OsPUB15__, [The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and innate immunity.%5BTitle%5D)), These results reveal that the E3 ligase OsPUB15 interacts directly with the receptor-like kinase PID2 and regulates plant cell death and blast disease resistance
