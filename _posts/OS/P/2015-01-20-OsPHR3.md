1. __growth__, [Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Integrative comparison of the role of the PHR1 subfamily in phosphate signaling and homeostasis in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, unlike OsPHR2-overexpressing lines, which exhibited growth retardation under normal or Pi-deficient conditions, OsPHR3-overexpressing plants exhibited significant tolerance to low Pi stress but normal growth rates under normal Pi conditions, suggesting that OsPHR3 would be useful for molecular breeding to improve Pi uptake/use efficiency under phosphate-deficient conditions
