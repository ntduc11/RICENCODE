## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
2. __mitochondria__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
3. __root__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves

## Connection
1. __OsPDF1A__, __OsPDF1B__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes, Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions, OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves, Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
