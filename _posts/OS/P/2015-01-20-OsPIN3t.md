## Key message
1. __ethylene__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsPIN3t led to improved drought tolerance, and GUS activity significantly increased when OsPIN3tpro::GUS plants were subjected to 20% polyethylene glycol stress
2. __seedling__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport
3. __auxin__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify a putative auxin efflux carrier gene in rice, OsPIN3t, which acts in auxin polar transport but is also involved in the drought stress response in rice, Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport, Taken together, these results suggest that OsPIN3t is involved in auxin transport and the drought stress response, which suggests that a polar auxin transport pathway is involved in the regulation of the response to water stress in plants,The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance
4. __crown root__, [The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The putative auxin efflux carrier OsPIN3t is involved in the drought stress response and drought tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, knockdown of OsPIN3t caused crown root abnormalities in the seedling stage that could be phenocopied by treatment of wild-type plants with NPA, which indicated that OsPIN3t is involved in the control of polar auxin transport
