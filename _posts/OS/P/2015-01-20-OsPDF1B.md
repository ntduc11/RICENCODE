## Key message
1. __root__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves
2. __chloroplast__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria, Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria
3. __mitochondria__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria, Based on these results, we conclude that OsPDF1B is essential for the development of chloroplast and perhaps mitochondria

## Connection
1. __OsPDF1A__, __OsPDF1B__, [Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice peptide deformylase PDF1B is crucial for development of chloroplasts%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice contains three copies (OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B and OsPDF1B2) of the PDF genes, Unlike OsPDF1A and OsPDF1B, OsPDF1B2 is apparently non-functional, with several deleterious substitutions and deletions, OsPDF1A is more strongly expressed in the roots, while OsPDF1B is expressed at higher levels in mature leaves, Transient expression of PDF-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in the protoplasts demonstrates that, unlike OsPDF1A, OsPDF1B is localized in both the chloroplasts and the mitochondria
