## Publication

[Protein repair l -isoaspartyl methyltransferase 1 (PIMT1) in rice improves seed longevity by preserving embryo vigor and viability.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Protein repair l -isoaspartyl methyltransferase 1 (PIMT1) in rice improves seed longevity by preserving embryo vigor and viability.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant Mol Biol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Confocal visualization of the transient expression of OsPIMTs showed that OsPIMT2 was localized in the chloroplast and nucleus, whereas OsPIMT1 was predominately found in the cytosol |  Overexpression of OsPIMT1 in transgenic seeds reduced the accumulation of isoAsp-containing protein in embryos, and increased embryo viability  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of OsPIMT1 in transgenic seeds reduced the accumulation of isoAsp-containing protein in embryos, and increased embryo viability  
__RNAi__: The germination percentage of transgenic seeds overexpressing OsPIMT1 increased 9-15 % compared to the WT seeds after 21-day of artificial aging, whereas seeds from the OsPIMT1 RNAi lines overaccumulated isoAsp in embryos and experienced rapid loss of seed germinability
