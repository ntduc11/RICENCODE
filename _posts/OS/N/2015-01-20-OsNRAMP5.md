## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap, The suppression of OsNRAMP5 promoted Cd translocation to shoots, highlighting the importance of this gene for Cd phytoremediation
2. __root__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
3. __transporter__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
4. __xylem__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem, OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
5. __growth__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 localized to the plasma membrane, and complemented the growth of yeast strains defective in Mn, Fe, and Cd transport, These data reveal that OsNRAMP5 contributes to Mn, Cd, and Fe transport in rice and is important for plant growth and development
6. __grain__, [Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ion-beam irradiation, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in the development of low-cadmium rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Functional analysis revealed that the defective transporter protein encoded by the mutant osnramp5 greatly decreases Cd uptake by roots, resulting in decreased Cd in the straw and grain
7. __root__, [Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizing the role of rice NRAMP5 in Manganese, Iron and Cadmium Transport%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP5 expression was restricted to roots epidermis, exodermis, and outer layers of the cortex as well as in tissues around the xylem, OsNRAMP5 RNAi (OsNRAMP5i) plants accumulated less Mn in the roots, and less Mn and Fe in shoots, and xylem sap
