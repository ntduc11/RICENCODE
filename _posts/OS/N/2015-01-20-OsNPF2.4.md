## Information
__Symbol__: OsNPF2.4  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os03g48180](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os03g48180)  
__RAPdb__: [Os03g0687000](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os03g0687000)  

## Publication
1. [Rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.4 functions in low-affinity acquisition and long-distance transport](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice nitrate transporter OsNPF2.4 functions in low-affinity acquisition and long-distance transport%5BTitle%5D)), 2014, J Exp Bot.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__:OsNPF2.4 is located in the plasma membrane and is expressed mainly in the epidermis, xylem parenchyma, and phloem companion cells  
__OverExpression__:Short-term 15NO3- influx rate, long-term NO3- acquisition by root, and upward transfer from root to shoot were decreased by disruption of OsNPF2.4 and increased by OsNPF2.4 overexpression under high NO3- supply.  
__RNAi__:Knockout of OsNPF2.4 decreased rice growth and potassium (K) concentration in xylem sap, root, culm, and sheath, but increased the shoot:root ratio of tissue K under higher NO3-.
