## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that all of the observed mutant phenotypes result from a missense mutation in a putative NST gene, Oryza sativa Nucleotide Sugar Transporter1 (OsNST1), OsNST1 was identified as a Golgi-localized transporter by analysis of a fluorescence-tagged OsNST1 expressed in rice protoplast cells and demonstration of UDP-glucose transport activity via uptake assays in yeast
2. __growth__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
3. __cell wall__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth
4. __cellulose__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
5. __cellulose__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development, Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
6. __cell wall__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The inferior mechanical strength and abnormal development of bc14 plants suggest that OsNST1 has pleiotropic effects on cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth, Identification of OsNST1 has improved our understanding of how cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is regulated by Golgi NSTs in plants
7. __culm__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
8. __cell wall__, [Golgi-localized UDP-glucose transporter is required for cell wall integrity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi-localized UDP-glucose transporter is required for cell wall integrity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously examined cell wall composition of bc14 and wild type plants
9. __culm__, [Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Golgi nucleotide sugar transporter modulates cell wall biosynthesis and plant growth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A previously undescribed Golgi NST mutant, brittle culm14 (bc14), displays reduced mechanical strength caused by decreased cellulose content and altered wall structure, and exhibits abnormalities in plant development, Compositional sugar analyses in total and fractionated wall residues of wild-type and bc14 culms showed a deficiency in the synthesis of glucoconjugated polysaccharides in bc14, indicating that OsNST1 supplies the glucosyl substrate for the formation of matrix polysaccharides, and thereby modulates cellulose biosynthesis
