## Key message
1. __sterile__, [The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein%5BTitle%5D)), Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage
2. __pollen__, [The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein%5BTitle%5D)), Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage, Thus, the delegen 14 gene is the best candidate for Osnop, corresponding to the pollen-less phenotype in the mutant,The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein
3. __flower__, [The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Oryza sativa no pollen (Osnop) gene plays a role in male gametophyte development and most likely encodes a C2-GRAM domain-containing protein%5BTitle%5D)), Phenotype screens of Ds insertional lines identified a male sterile Orysa sativa no pollen (Osnop) mutant with a pollen-less phenotype at the flowering stage
