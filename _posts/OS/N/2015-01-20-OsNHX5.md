2. __seedling__, [Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes%5BTitle%5D)),  When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters
3. __grain__, [Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains

## Connection
1. __OsNHX1__, __OsNHX5__, [Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular and functional analyses of rice NHX-type Na+/H+ antiporter genes%5BTitle%5D)),  The exon-intron structure of the OsNHX genes and the phylogenetic tree of the OsNHX proteins suggest that the OsNHX proteins are categorized into two subgroups (OsNHX1 through OsNHX4 and OsNHX5), OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 can suppress the Na+, Li+, and hygromycin sensitivity of yeast nhx1 mutants and their sensitivity to a high K+ concentration, The expression of OsNHX1, OsNHX2, OsNHX3, and OsNHX5 is regulated differently in rice tissues and is increased by salt stress, hyperosmotic stress, and ABA, When we studied the expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) driven by either the OsNHX1 or the OsNHX5 promoter, we observed activity in the stele, the emerging part of lateral roots, the vascular bundle, the water pore, and the basal part of seedling shoots with both promoters, OsNHX1 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the guard cells and trichome, whereas OsNHX5 promoter-GUS activity only was localized to the root tip and pollen grains
