1. [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)), 2013, PLoS One.

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Additionally, compared with wild type, leaf Mn content in osnramp3 plants was mostly in older leaves
2. __root__, [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Serious necrosis appeared on young leaves and root tips of the OsNRAMP3 knockout line cultivated under low Mn conditions, and high Mn supplies could rescue this phenotype
3. __vascular bundle__, [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsNRAMP3 encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein and was specifically expressed in vascular bundles, especially in phloem cells, We conclude that OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundle-localized Mn-influx transporter involved in Mn distribution and contributes to remobilization of Mn from old to young leaves,OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
4. __transporter__, [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Yeast complementation assay showed that OsNRAMP3 is a functional Mn-influx transporter, We conclude that OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundle-localized Mn-influx transporter involved in Mn distribution and contributes to remobilization of Mn from old to young leaves,OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
5. __manganese__, [OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsNRAMP3 is a vascular bundles-specific manganese transporter that is responsible for manganese distribution in rice
