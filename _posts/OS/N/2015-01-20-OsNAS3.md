## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, the OsNAS3 transcript was present in leaves but was very low in roots of Fe-sufficient plants, Further, OsNAS3 expression was induced in roots but was suppressed in leaves in response to Fe deficiency, OsNAS3 expression was restricted to the pericycle and companion cells of the roots, and in companion cells of leaves irrespective of Fe status
2. __root__, [Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn
3. __shoot__, [Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Shoots and roots of the OsNAS3 activation-tagged plants (OsNAS3-D1) accumulated more Fe and Zn
4. __seed__, [Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron fortification of rice seeds through activation of the nicotianamine synthase gene%5BTitle%5D)),  Seeds from our OsNAS3-D1 plants grown on a paddy field contained elevated amounts of Fe (2,6-fold in OsNAS3-D1 seeds, Analysis by size exclusion chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy showed that WT and OsNAS3-D1 seeds contained equal amounts of Fe bound to IP6, whereas OsNAS3-D1 had 7-fold more Fe bound to a low molecular mass, which was likely NA
5. __transcription factor__, [Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of OsNAC5, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of up-regulated genes in flag leaves during rice grain filling and characterization of OsNAC5, a new ABA-dependent transcription factor%5BTitle%5D)),  Differential expression of selected genes (encoding 7 transport proteins, the OsNAS3 enzyme and the OsNAC5 transcription factor) was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR
6. __iron__, [Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron%5BTitle%5D)), Three rice nicotianamine synthase genes, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, and OsNAS3 are expressed in cells involved in long-distance transport of iron and differentially regulated by iron
