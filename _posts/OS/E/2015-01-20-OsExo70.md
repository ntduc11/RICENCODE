## Publication
1. [Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant J.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: In our current experimental conditions, overexpression of AVR-Pii or knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and -F3 genes in rice did not affect the virulence of compatible isolates of M  
__OverExpression__: In our current experimental conditions, overexpression of AVR-Pii or knockdown of OsExo70-F2 and -F3 genes in rice did not affect the virulence of compatible isolates of M  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __immunity__, [Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice Exo70 interacts with a fungal effector, AVR-Pii and is required for AVR-Pii-triggered immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  AVR-Pii interaction with OsExo70-F3 seems to play a crucial role in effector triggered immunity by Pii, suggesting the role of OsExo70 as decoy or helper in Pii/AVR-Pii interactions
