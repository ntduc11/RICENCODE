## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
2. __biomass__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
3. __root__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria
4. __vascular bundle__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization revealed that OsENOD93-1 is expressed in vascular bundles, as well as in epidermis and endodermis
5. __mitochondria__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  This OsENOD93-1 gene was expressed at high levels in roots of wild-type (WT) plants, and its protein product was localized in mitochondria
6. __seed__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
7. __yield__, [Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Increased nitrogen-use efficiency in transgenic rice plants over-expressing a nitrogen-responsive early nodulin gene identified from rice expression profiling%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic rice plants over-expressing the OsENOD93-1 gene had increased shoot dry biomass and seed yield
