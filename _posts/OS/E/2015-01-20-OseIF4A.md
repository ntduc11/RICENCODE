## Connection
1. __OsDRM2__, __OseIF4A__, [De novo methyltransferase, OsDRM2, interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, OseIF4A, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(De novo methyltransferase, OsDRM2, interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, OseIF4A, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Deletion analysis reveals that interaction between OsDRM2 and OseIF4A is specifically mediated through ubiquitin-associated domain of OsDRM2 while, both domains 1 and 2 of OseIF4A are critical for mediating strong interaction with OsDRM2 in vivo, Interaction between Arabidopsis eIF4AI and eIF4AII with OsDRM2 and nuclear localization of these complexes suggests possible conservation of functional interaction between de novo methyltransferases and the translation initiation factor, eIF4A, in RdDM across plant species,De novo methyltransferase, OsDRM2, interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, OseIF4A, in rice, We report that rice DRM2 interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, eIF4A
