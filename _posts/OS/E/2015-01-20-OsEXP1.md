## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root__, [Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Combinative effects of a bacterial type-III effector and a biocontrol bacterium on rice growth and disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  In both plants, the expression of OsEXP1, which encodes an expansin protein involved in plant growth,was concomitant with growth promotion in leaves instead of roots,in response to P
