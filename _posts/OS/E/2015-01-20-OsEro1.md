## Key message
1. __seed__, [ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Inhibition of the formation of native disulfide bonds was also observed in the seeds of the esp2 mutant, which lacks protein disulfide isomerase-like (PDIL)1;1, but shows enhanced OsEro1 expression
2. __endosperm__, [ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ER membrane-localized oxidoreductase Ero1 is required for disulfide bond formation in the rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we investigated an electron transfer pathway for the formation of protein disulfide bonds in the rER of the rice endosperm, focusing on the roles of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, OsEro1
