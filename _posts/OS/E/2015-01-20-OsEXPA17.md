## Expression information

## Key message
1. __root hair__, [Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified a gene encoding EXPA17 (OsEXPA17) from a rice mutant with short root hairs, Promoter::reporter transgenic lines exhibited exclusive OsEXPA17 expression in root hair cells, Suppression of OsEXPA17 by RNA interference further confirmed requirement for the gene in root hair elongation, Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots
2. __root__, [Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Root hair-specific expansins modulate root hair elongation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified a gene encoding EXPA17 (OsEXPA17) from a rice mutant with short root hairs, Promoter::reporter transgenic lines exhibited exclusive OsEXPA17 expression in root hair cells, Suppression of OsEXPA17 by RNA interference further confirmed requirement for the gene in root hair elongation, Complementation of the OsEXPA17 mutant with other root hair EXPAs (OsEXPA30 and Arabidopsis EXPA7) can restore root hair elongation, indicating functional conservation of these root hair EXPAs in monocots and dicots
