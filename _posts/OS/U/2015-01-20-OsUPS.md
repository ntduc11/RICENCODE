## Expression information

## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  A self-ubiquitination assay indicated that the bacterially expressed OsUPS protein had E3 ligase activity, and subcellular localization results showed that OsUPS was located in the chloroplast
2. __phosphate__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we present the isolation of a novel U-box protein, U-box containing E3 ligase induced by phosphate starvation (OsUPS), from rice (Oryza sativa), We found that full-length expression of OsUPS was up-regulated in both rice plants and cell culture in the absence of inorganic phosphate (P(i)),Molecular cloning and characterization of OsUPS, a U-box containing E3 ligase gene that respond to phosphate starvation in rice (Oryza sativa)
