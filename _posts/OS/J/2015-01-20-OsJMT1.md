## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [Methyl jasmonate reduces grain yield by mediating stress signals to alter spikelet development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Methyl jasmonate reduces grain yield by mediating stress signals to alter spikelet development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Two genes, OsJMT1 and OsSDR (for short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase), are involved in MeJA and ABA biosynthesis, respectively, in rice (Oryza sativa)
2. __yield__, [Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
3. __brown planthopper__, [Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsJMT1 is up-regulated in response to infestation with the brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens)
4. __height__, [Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Plants in which OsJMT1 had been overexpressed (oe-JMT plants) showed reduced height and yield
5. __ ja __, [Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
6. __JA__, [Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase regulates development and herbivory-induced defense response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  After we cloned a rice JMT gene, OsJMT1, whose encoding protein was localized in the cytosol, we found that the recombinant OsJMT1 protein catalyzed JA to MeJA
