## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings indicate that over-expression of OsHsfA7 gene can increase tolerance to salt and drought stresses in rice seedlings
2. __drought__, [Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These findings indicate that over-expression of OsHsfA7 gene can increase tolerance to salt and drought stresses in rice seedlings,Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice
3. __drought tolerance__, [Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)), Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice
4. __salt__, [Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Under salt treatment, over-expressing OsHsfA7 rice showed alleviative appearance of damage symptoms and higher survival rate, leaf electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content of transgenic plants were lower than those of wild type plants, These findings indicate that over-expression of OsHsfA7 gene can increase tolerance to salt and drought stresses in rice seedlings,Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice"
5. __leaf__, [Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Over-expression of OsHsfA7 enhanced salt and drought tolerance in transgenic rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Under salt treatment, over-expressing OsHsfA7 rice showed alleviative appearance of damage symptoms and higher survival rate, leaf electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde content of transgenic plants were lower than those of wild type plants
