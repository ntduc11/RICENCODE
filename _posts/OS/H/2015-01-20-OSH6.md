## Expression information

## Key message
1. __panicle__, [A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These data suggest that OSH6-Ds interferes with a developmental mechanism involved in bract differentiation, especially at the basal nodes of panicles
2. __growth__, [A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice
3. __leaf__, [A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The truncated mRNA was expressed ectopically in leaf tissues and encoded the N-terminal region of OSH6, which includes the KNOX1 and partial KNOX2 subdomains,A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice
4. __sheath__, [A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A Ds-insertion mutant of OSH6 (Oryza sativa Homeobox 6) exhibits outgrowth of vestigial leaf-like structures, bracts, in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These phenotypes distinguished it from the OSH6 transgene whose ectopic expression led to a blade to sheath transformation phenotype at the midrib region of leaves, similar to that seen in dominant Lg3 mutants
