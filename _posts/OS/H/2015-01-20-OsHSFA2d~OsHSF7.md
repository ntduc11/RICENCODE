## Key message
1. __transcription factor__, [OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor%5BTitle%5D)), OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor
2. __temperature__, ["OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor"%5BTitle%5D)), " The OsHSF7 gene was found to be rapidly expressed in high levels in response to temperature, which indicates that it may be involved in heat stress reception and response, Collectively, the results of this study indicate that OsHSF7 might play an important role in the response to high temperature, Specifically, these findings indicate that OsHSF7 may be useful in the production of transgenic monocots that can over-express protective genes such as HSPs in response to heat stress, which will enable such plants to tolerate high temperatures,OsHSF7 gene in rice, Oryza sativa L., encodes a transcription factor that functions as a high temperature receptive and responsive factor"
3. __stress__, [An alternatively spliced heat shock transcription factor, OsHSFA2dI, functions in the heat stress-induced unfolded protein response in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An alternatively spliced heat shock transcription factor, OsHSFA2dI, functions in the heat stress-induced unfolded protein response in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  However, when the plant suffers heat stress, OsHSFA2d is alternatively spliced into a transcriptionally active form, OsHSFA2dI, which participates in the heat stress response (HSR)
