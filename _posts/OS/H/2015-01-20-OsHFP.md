## Expression information

## Key message
1. __cell death__, [A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation%5BTitle%5D)),  The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed
2. __root__, [A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation%5BTitle%5D)),  Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue
3. __leaf__, [A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation%5BTitle%5D)),  Heterologous expression of OsHFP in green leaf tissues resulted in chlorophyll degradation; however, stable expression of OsHFP was observed in transgenic hairy roots, a non-green tissue
4. __flower__, [A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the single copy OsHFP gene was detected in rice flower buds
5. __anther__, [A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A structurally novel hemopexin fold protein of rice plays role in chlorophyll degradation%5BTitle%5D)),  The possible role of OsHFP in regulating programmed cell death in anther green tissues of rice is proposed
