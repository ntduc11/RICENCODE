## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " These results suggest that OsHsfB2b functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity"
2. __cold stress__, [Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress"
3. __ethylene__, [Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsHsfB2b was strongly induced by heat, salt, abscisic acid (ABA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments but was almost not affected by cold stress

5. __salt tolerance__, [Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by OsHsfB2b overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference, Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased in OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice, but were enhanced in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice,Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice"
6. __drought__, [Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased by OsHsfB2b overexpression, but were enhanced by RNA interference, Drought and salt tolerances were significantly decreased in OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice, but were enhanced in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice, Under drought stress, the OsHsfB2b-overexpressing transgenic rice exhibited increased relative electrical conductivity (REC) and content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased proline content compared with the wild type, while the lower REC and MDA content and increased proline content were found in the OsHsfB2b-RNAi transgenic rice, These results suggest that OsHsfB2b functions as a negative regulator in response to drought and salt stresses in rice, with its existing B3 repression domain (BRD) that might be necessary for the repressive activity,Heat shock factor OsHsfB2b negatively regulates drought and salt tolerance in rice"
