## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  At the seedling stage, we identified heat-sensitive mutants that carried T-DNA inserted into a heat shock protein 70 gene, OsHsp70CP1
2. __chloroplast__, [Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures,Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions
3. __temperature__, ["Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions"%5BTitle%5D)), " This indicated that OsHsp70CP1 is essential for chloroplast differentiation from the proplastids under high temperatures,Rice chloroplast-localized heat shock protein 70, OsHsp70CP1, is essential for chloroplast development under high-temperature conditions"
