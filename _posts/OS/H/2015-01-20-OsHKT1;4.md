## Key message
1. __sheath__, [A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing%5BTitle%5D)),  For OsHKT1;4, alternative splicing of transcript and the anatomical complexity of the sheath needed to be taken into account, Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath
2. __leaf__, [A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, Na(+) accumulation in a specific leaf blade seems to be regulated by abundance of a correctly spliced OsHKT1;4 transcript in a corresponding sheath

## Connection
1. __OsHKT1;4__, __OsHKT1;5~SKC1~OsHKT8__, [A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A two-staged model of Na+ exclusion in rice explained by 3D modeling of HKT transporters and alternative splicing%5BTitle%5D)),  Amongst these transporters, the cereal HKT1;4 and HKT1;5 are responsible for Na(+) exclusion from photosynthetic tissues, a key mechanism for plant salinity tolerance
