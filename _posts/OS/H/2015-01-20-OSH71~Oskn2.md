## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology
2. __panicle__, [Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
3. __flower__, [Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of the KNOX class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 identified in a collection of cDNA libraries covering the early stages of rice embryogenesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Whereas Oskn3 transformants showed the most pronounced phenotypic effects during vegetative development, Oskn2 transformants showed relatively mild alterations in the vegetative phase but a more severely affected flower morphology
4. __shoot__, [KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
5. __branching__, [Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Developmental regulation and downstream effects of the knox class homeobox genes Oskn2 and Oskn3 from rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ectopic expression of Oskn2 or Oskn3 induced similar defects in panicle branching
6. __growth__, [KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(KNOX homeobox genes are sufficient in maintaining cultured cells in an undifferentiated state in rice%5BTitle%5D)), We produced transgenic rice calli, which constitutively express each of four KNOX family class 1 homeobox genes of rice, OSH1, OSH16, OSH15, and OSH71, and found that constitutive and ectopic expression of such genes inhibits normal regeneration from transformed calli, which showed continuous growth around their shoot-regenerating stages
