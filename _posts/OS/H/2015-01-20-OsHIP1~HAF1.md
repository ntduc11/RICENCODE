## Key message
1. __heading date__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.
2. __heading date__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  The haf1 mutant exhibits a later flowering heading date under both short-day and long-day conditions
3. __heading date__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions
4. __Ubiquitin__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.

## Connection
1. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, Heading date Associated Factor 1 (HAF1), which physically interacts with Hd1
2. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  HAF1 mediates ubiquitination and targets Hd1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway
3. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions
4. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, high levels of Hd1 accumulate in haf1
5. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that HAF1 is essential to precise modulation of the timing of Hd1 accumulation during the photoperiod response in rice
