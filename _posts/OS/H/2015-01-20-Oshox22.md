## Key message
1. __ ABA __, [Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox22 showed reduced Oshox22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage, In contrast, transgenic rice over-expressing Oshox22 showed increased sensitivity to ABA, increased ABA content, and decreased drought and salt tolerances, Based on these results, we conclude that Oshox22 affects ABA biosynthesis and regulates drought and salt responses through ABA-mediated signal transduction pathways
2. __transcription factor__, [Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Oshox22 belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) family I of transcription factors, most of which have unknown functions
3. __salt stress__, [Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Function of the HD-Zip I gene Oshox22 in ABA-mediated drought and salt tolerances in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Here we show that the expression of Oshox22 is strongly induced by salt stress, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol treatment (PEG), and weakly by cold stress, Rice plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in the promoter region of Oshox22 showed reduced Oshox22 expression and ABA content, decreased sensitivity to ABA, and enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses at the seedling stage"
