## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D)),  Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth
2. __growth__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D)),  Notably, the expression of OsHXK5, OsHXK6, or their mutant alleles complemented the Arabidopsis glucose insensitive2-1 mutant, thereby resulting in wild-type characteristics in seedling development, Glc-dependent gene expression, and plant growth, Furthermore, transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsHXK5 or OsHXK6 exhibited hypersensitive plant growth retardation and enhanced repression of the photosynthetic gene RbcS in response to Glc treatment
3. __mitochondria__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria, Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol, In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei
