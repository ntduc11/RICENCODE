1. __leaf__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
2. __gibberellin__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)), Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses

5. __dwarf__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Over-expression of Oshox4 in rice induced a semi-dwarf phenotype that could not be complemented by applied GA3
6. __meristem__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized
7. __ ga __, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants, These data together suggest that Oshox4 may be involved in the negative regulation of GA signalling and may play a role to fine tune GA responses in rice
8. __shoot apical meristem__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Oshox4 transcripts were detected in leaf and floral organ primordia but excluded from the shoot apical meristem and the protein was nuclear localized

## Connection
