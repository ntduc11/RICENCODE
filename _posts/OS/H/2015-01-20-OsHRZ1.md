## Key message
1. __zinc__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2, OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity
2. __iron__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the identification of new iron regulators in rice, designated Oryza sativa Haemerythrin motif-containing Really Interesting New Gene (RING)- and Zinc-finger protein 1 (OsHRZ1) and OsHRZ2, OsHRZ1, OsHRZ2 and their Arabidopsis homologue BRUTUS bind iron and zinc, and possess ubiquitination activity, OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions, These results suggest that OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are iron-binding sensors that negatively regulate iron acquisition under conditions of iron sufficiency
3. __root__, [Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Iron-binding Haemerythrin RING ubiquitin ligases regulate plant iron responses and accumulation%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHRZ1 and OsHRZ2 are susceptible to degradation in roots irrespective of iron conditions
