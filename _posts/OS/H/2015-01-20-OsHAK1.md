## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we report the expression patterns and physiological roles of OsHAK1, a member belonging to KT/KUP/HAK gene family in rice (Oryza sativa L) |  Expression of OsHAK1 is up-regulated by K deficiency or salt stress in various tissues, particularly in the root and shoot apical meristem, the epidermises and steles of root, and vascular bundles of shoot |  Over-expression of OsHAK1 in rice increased K uptake and K/Na ratio
