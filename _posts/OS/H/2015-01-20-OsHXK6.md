3. __mitochondria__, [Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Role of the rice hexokinases OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 as glucose sensors%5BTitle%5D)),  Transient expression analyses using GFP fusion constructs revealed that OsHXK5 and OsHXK6 are associated with mitochondria, Interestingly, the OsHXK5DeltamTP-GFP and OsHXK6DeltamTP-GFP fusion proteins, which lack N-terminal mitochondrial targeting peptides, were present mainly in the nucleus with a small amount of the proteins seen in the cytosol, In addition, the OsHXK5NLS-GFP and OsHXK6NLS-GFP fusion proteins harboring nuclear localization signals were targeted predominantly in the nucleus, suggesting that these OsHXKs retain a dual-targeting ability to mitochondria and nuclei
