## Key message
1. __cadmium__, [Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein%5BTitle%5D)),  Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
2. __zinc__, [Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein%5BTitle%5D)),  Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
3. __seedling__, [Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice P1B-type heavy-metal ATPase, OsHMA9, is a metal efflux protein%5BTitle%5D)),  Semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of seedlings showed that OsHMA9 expression was induced by a high concentration of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and cadmium
