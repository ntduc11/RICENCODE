## Genbank accession number
[FJ809894](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ809894)

## Expression information
__Expression__: OsHAL3 overexpression lines exhibited an early flowering phenotype, and diminished expression of OsHAL3 by RNA interference delayed flowering under an inductive photoperiod (short-day conditions)  
__OverExpression__: OsHAL3 overexpression lines exhibited an early flowering phenotype, and diminished expression of OsHAL3 by RNA interference delayed flowering under an inductive photoperiod (short-day conditions)  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice
2. __cell division__, [OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity
3. __nucleus__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light

## Connection
1. __Hd1__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.
2. __Hd1__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsHAL3 and Hd1 colocalized to the nucleus in vivo and interacted physically in the dark, but the interaction was inhibited by white or blue light
3. __Hd1__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We conclude that OsHAL3, a novel light responsive protein, plays an essential role in photoperiodic control of flowering time in rice, which is probably mediated by forming a complex with Hd1
4. __Hd3a__, __OsHAL3__, [OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3, a new component interacts with the floral regulator Hd1 to activate flowering in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsHAL3 directly bound to the promoter of Hd3a, especially before dawn
