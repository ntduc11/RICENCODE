## Expression information

## Key message
1. __growth__, [OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)), OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice
2. __cell division__, [OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsHAL3 mediates a new pathway in the light-regulated growth of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Further investigation suggested that OsHAL3 promotes cell division by recruiting a ubiquitin system, rather than by its 4'-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (PPC) decarboxylase activity
