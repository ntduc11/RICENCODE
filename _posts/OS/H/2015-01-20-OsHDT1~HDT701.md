## Expression information
__Expression__:Expression and functional analysis of the plant-specific histone deacetylase HDT701 in rice. |  In this work, we examined the subcellular localization, expression pattern and function of HDT701, a member of the plant-specific HD2-type histone deacetylase in rice |  Overexpression of HDT701 in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDT701 overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDT701 in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of HDT701 in rice decreases ABA, salt and osmotic stress resistance during seed germination |  Delayed seed germination of HDT701 overexpression lines is associated with decreased histone H4 acetylation and down-regulated expression of GA biosynthetic genes |  Moreover, overexpression of HDT701 in rice enhances salt and osmotic stress resistance during the seedling stage
