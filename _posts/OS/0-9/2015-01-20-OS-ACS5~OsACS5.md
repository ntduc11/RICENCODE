## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
2. __seedling__, [Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Tissue localization of a submergence-induced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Previously, the OS-ACS5 gene has been shown to be induced during short- as well as long-term complete submergence of seedlings and to be controlled by a balance of gibberellin and abscisic acid in both lowland and deepwater rice, Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed that in air-grown rice seedlings, OS-ACS5 was expressed at a low level in the shoot apex, meristems, leaf, and adventitious root primordia, and in vascular tissues of nonelongated stems and leaf sheaths
