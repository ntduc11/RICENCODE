## Key message
1. __inflorescence__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
2. __salt__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress%5BTitle%5D)), " Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress"
3. __shoot__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, Os6PGDH was up-regulated in the shoots under salt stress
4. __root__, [Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular cloning and characterization of rice 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene that is up-regulated by salt stress%5BTitle%5D)),  RT-PCR experiments revealed that Os6PGDH expression was high in inflorescence, low in root and embryos but almost absent in leaves
