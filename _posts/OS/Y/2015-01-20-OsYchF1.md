## Expression information

## Key message
1. __defense__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D)),  The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants
2. __defense response__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D)),  The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants

## Connection
1. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D)),  Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1), The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed, The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants

3. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).%5BTitle%5D)),  We have previously reported that a member of this group, OsGAP1, is able to alleviate salt stress and stimulate defense responses, and bind to both phospholipids and an unconventional G-protein, OsYchF1
4. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Site-Directed Mutagenesis Shows the Significance of Interactions with Phospholipids and the G-protein OsYchF1 on the Physiological Functions of the Rice GTPase-Activating Protein 1 (OsGAP1).%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, the ability to alleviate salt stress by OsGAP1 is dependent only on its ability to bind OsYchF1 and is independent of its phospholipid-binding activity
