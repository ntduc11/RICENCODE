## Expression information

## Key message
1. __floral__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Unlike the Arabidopsis YABBY genes, however, the OsYAB1 gene does not show polar expression pattern in the tissues of floral organs, Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures
2. __flower__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  RNA gel-blot analysis showed that the OsYAB1 gene is preferentially expressed in flowers
3. __vascular bundle__, [Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves
4. __lemma__, [Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1%5BTitle%5D)),  In the flower, OsYABBY1 is specifically expressed in the palea and lemma from their inception, and is confined to several cell layers of these organs in the later developmental stages
5. __sheath__, [Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization the YABBY gene family in Oryza sativa and expression analysis of OsYABBY1%5BTitle%5D)),  OsYABBY1 is expressed in putative precursor cells of both the mestome sheath in the large vascular bundle and the abaxial sclerenchyma in the leaves

7. __growth__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures
8. __meristem__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsYAB1 plays a major role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels, rather than in determining polarity
9. __vegetative__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our transgenic plants that ectopically expressed OsYAB1 were normal during the vegetative growth period, but then showed abnormalities in their floral structures

11. __stamen__, [Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that OsYAB1 plays a major role in meristem development and maintenance of stamens and carpels, rather than in determining polarity,Ectopic expression of OsYAB1 causes extra stamens and carpels in rice

## Connection
1. __Oshox4__, __OsYABBY1~OsYAB1__, [Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of rice HOMEOBOX4 (Oshox4) gene reveals a negative function in gibberellin responses%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, the expression of YAB1 that is involved in the negative feedback regulation of the GA biosynthesis was upregulated in the Oshox4 over-expressing plants, One-hybrid assays showed that Oshox4 could interact with YAB1 promoter in yeast
2. __d18~OsGA3ox2__, __OsYABBY1~OsYAB1__, [The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2, Cosuppression of YAB1 in transgenic plants induced expression of GA3ox2, The repression of GA3ox2 could be obtained upon treatment by dexamethasone of transgenic plants expressing a YAB1-glucocorticoid receptor fusion, Importantly, we show that YAB1 bound to a GA-responsive element within the GA3ox2 promoter, Finally, either overexpression or cosuppression of YAB1 impaired GA-mediated repression of GA3ox2
3. __OsYABBY1~OsYAB1__, __sd1~GA20ox2__, [The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice YABBY1 gene is involved in the feedback regulation of gibberellin metabolism%5BTitle%5D)),  In this report, we show that a rice (Oryza sativa) YABBY1 (YAB1) gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox2 and GA20ox2
