## Key message
1. __root__, [OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the OsYSL16 promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene showed that OsYSL16 is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants
2. __iron__, [Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant,Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency
3. __seed__, [Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  During germination, the rate of Fe-utilization from the seeds was higher in the OsYSL16 activation lines than in the WT seeds
4. __leaf__, [Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Promoter fusions of OsYSL16 to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) showed that OsYSL16 was highly expressed in the vascular tissues of the root, leaf, and spikelet, and in leaf mesophyll cells
5. __iron__, [OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron%5BTitle%5D)),  OsYSL16 has 85 % similarity to both OsYSL15 and the iron(II)-nicotianamine transporter OsYSL2, In the present study, we show that OsYSL16 functionally complemented a yeast mutant defective in iron uptake when grown on medium containing iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid, but not when grown on medium containing iron(II)-nicotianamine, OsYSL16-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source, The iron concentration in shoots of OsYSL16-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions, Furthermore, OsYSL16-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves, Our results suggest that OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles,OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron
6. __vascular bundle__, [OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsYSL16-knockdown plants accumulated more iron in the vascular bundles of the leaves, Expression of the OsYSL16 promoter fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene showed that OsYSL16 is expressed in the root epidermis and vascular bundles of whole plants, Our results suggest that OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron(III)-deoxymugineic acid via the vascular bundles

10. __seedling__, [OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron%5BTitle%5D)),  OsYSL16-knockdown seedlings were smaller than wild-type seedlings when only iron(III)chloride was supplied as an iron source
11. __homeostasis__, [Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Activation of rice Yellow Stripe1-Like 16 (OsYSL16) enhances iron efficiency%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that the function of OsYSL16 in Fe-homeostasis is to enable distribution of iron within a plant
12. __shoot__, [OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL16 plays a role in the allocation of iron%5BTitle%5D)),  The iron concentration in shoots of OsYSL16-knockdown plants was similar to that of the wild type; however, they showed more severe chlorosis than wild-type plants under iron-deficient conditions
