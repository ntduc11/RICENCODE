## Expression information

## Key message
1. __manganese__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition,OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice
2. __transporter__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results suggest that OsYSL6 is a Mn-nicotianamine transporter that is required for the detoxification of excess Mn in rice
3. __shoot__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition, OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals, Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots
4. __growth__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition
5. __root__, [OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsYSL6 is involved in the detoxification of excess manganese in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsYSL6 resulted in decreased growth of both roots and shoots only in the high-manganese (Mn) condition, OsYSL6 was constitutively expressed in both the shoots and roots, and the expression level was not affected by either deficiency or toxicity of various metals, Analysis with OsYSL6 promoter-green fluorescent protein transgenic rice revealed that OsYSL6 was expressed in all cells of both the roots and shoots
