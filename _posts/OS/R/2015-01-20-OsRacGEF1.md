## Expression information

## Key message
1. __resistance__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection
2. __blast__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection
3. __immune response__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Activated OsRacGEF1 is required for chitin-driven immune responses and resistance to rice blast fungus infection
4. __plasma membrane__, [New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that rice OsRacGEF1 forms homodimers, and heterodimers with OsRacGEF2, at the plasma membrane (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
5. __Kinase__, [New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New insights into the dimerization of small GTPase Rac/ROP guanine nucleotide exchange factors in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRacGEF2 does not bind directly to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) OsCERK1, but forms a complex with OsCERK1 through OsRacGEF1 at the ER

## Connection
1. __CEBiP~OsCEBiP__, __OsRacGEF1__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity
2. __OsCERK1__, __OsRacGEF1__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsRacGEF1 interacts with OsCERK1 and is activated when its C-terminal S549 is phosphorylated by the cytoplasmic domain of OsCERK1 in response to chitin
3. __OsCERK1__, __OsRacGEF1__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Further, a protein complex including OsCERK1 and OsRacGEF1 is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the PM

6. __OsRac1__, __OsRacGEF1__, [An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An OsCEBiP/OsCERK1-OsRacGEF1-OsRac1 module is an essential early component of chitin-induced rice immunity.%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, our results suggest that OsCEBiP, OsCERK1, OsRacGEF1, and OsRac1 function as key components of a &quot;defensome&quot; critically engaged early during chitin-induced immunity
