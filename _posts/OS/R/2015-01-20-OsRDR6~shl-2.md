## Expression information
__Expression__: We found previously that rice RDR6 (OsRDR6) functioned in the defense against Rice stripe virus (RSV), and Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus (RDV) infection resulted in down-regulation of expression of RDR6 |  Our result showed that down-regulation of OsRDR6 through the antisense (OsRDR6AS) strategy increased rice susceptibility to RDV infection while over-expression of OsRDR6 had no effect on RDV infection

## Key message
1. __spikelet__, [Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development%5BTitle%5D)),  We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects
2. __disease__, [RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus%5BTitle%5D)),  In three independent transgenic lines (OsRDR6AS line A, B and C) in which OsRDR6 transcription levels were reduced by 70-80% through antisense silencing, the infection and disease symptoms of RSV were shown to be significantly enhanced
3. __insect__, [RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 of rice (Oryza sativa) plays role in host defense against negative-strand RNA virus, Rice stripe virus%5BTitle%5D)),  The hypersusceptibilities of the OsRDR6AS plants were attributed not to enhanced insect infestation but to enhanced virus infection
4. __temperature__, [Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 acts in small RNA biogenesis and spikelet development%5BTitle%5D)), " We isolated a rice osrdr6-1 mutant, which was temperature sensitive and showed spikelet defects"
5. __ ABA __, [Phytohormone abscisic acid control RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 gene expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing in rice cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytohormone abscisic acid control RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 gene expression and post-transcriptional gene silencing in rice cells%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that ABA modulates PTGS through the transcriptional control of the OsRDR6 gene
6. __defense__, [OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.%5BTitle%5D)), OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.
7. __dwarf__, [OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.%5BTitle%5D)), OsRDR6 plays role in host defense against double-stranded RNA virus, Rice Dwarf Phytoreovirus.

## Connection
1. __OsRDR6~shl-2__, __OsSGS3__, [p2 of rice stripe virus (RSV) interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(p2 of rice stripe virus (RSV) interacts with OsSGS3 and is a silencing suppressor%5BTitle%5D)),  SGS3 has been shown to be involved in sense transgene-induced RNA silencing and in the biogenesis of trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs), possibly functioning as a cofactor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)
