## Key message
1. __resistance__, [Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and characterization of the drought-resistance OsRCI2-5 gene in rice (Oryza sativa L.).%5BTitle%5D)),  After polyethylene glycol-6000 and drought treatment, we found that the OsRCI2-5 gene improved the drought resistance of Nipponbare
