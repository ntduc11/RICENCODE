## Expression information

## Key message
1. __growth__, [Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase%5BTitle%5D)),  The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures
2. __seed__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  The ALA contents in the seeds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized GmFAD3-1 and OsFAD3 overexpression lines increased from 0, Homologous OsFAD3 is more active than GmFAD3-1 in catalysing LA conversion to ALA in rice seeds
3. __chilling__, ["Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase"%5BTitle%5D)), " The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures, Similar temperature responses of the OsFAD3 gene were observed both in chilling- tolerant and in chilling-intolerant rice cultivars"
4. __leaf__, [Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase%5BTitle%5D)),  The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures
5. __temperature__, ["Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase"%5BTitle%5D)), " In root tissues, a high level of the OsFAD3 mRNA was observed at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with its level decreasing markedly at temperatures below 10 degrees C, The accumulation of the OsFAD3 mRNA in leaf tissues remained at quite low levels, both at normal growth temperatures and at chilling temperatures, Similar temperature responses of the OsFAD3 gene were observed both in chilling- tolerant and in chilling-intolerant rice cultivars"
6. __root__, [Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structure, chromosomal location and expression of a rice gene encoding the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of the OsFAD3 cDNA in tobacco hairy root tissues and subsequent analysis of fatty acid compositions demonstrated the activity of the microsome omega-3 fatty acid desaturase, The OsFAD3 mRNA was abundant in root tissues, but was hardly detectable in leaves, In root tissues, a high level of the OsFAD3 mRNA was observed at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, with its level decreasing markedly at temperatures below 10 degrees C

## Connection
1. __OsFAD3__, __OsFAD7__, [Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and evaluation of omega-3 fatty acid desaturase genes for hyperfortifying alpha-linolenic acid in transgenic rice seed%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of ER-localized GmFAD3-2/3 and chloroplast-localized OsFAD7/8 had less effect on increasing the ALA content in rice seeds
