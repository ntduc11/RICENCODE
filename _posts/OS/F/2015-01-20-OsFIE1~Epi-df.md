## Key message
1. __floral__, [Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion
2. __dwarf__, [Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of an epi-allele of FIE1 reveals a regulatory linkage between two epigenetic marks in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify a gain-of-function epi-allele (Epi-df) of rice (Oryza sativa) FIE1; this allele causes a dwarf stature and various floral defects that are inherited in a dominant fashion
3. __endosperm__, [Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression, imprinting, and evolution of rice homologs of the polycomb group genes%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFIE1 is expressed only in endosperm; the maternal copy is expressed while the paternal copy is not active
