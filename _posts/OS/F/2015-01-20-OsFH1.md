1. __root hair__, [Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air
2. __root__, [Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  Subsequent analysis of two additional T-DNA mutants verified that OsFH1 is important for root-hair elongation, Further studies revealed that the action of OsFH1 on root-hair growth is dependent on growth conditions, The mutant Osfh1 exhibited root-hair defects when roots were grown submerged in solution, and mutant roots produced normal root hairs in the air, This study shows that OsFH1 plays a significant role in root-hair elongation in a growth condition-dependent manner,Formin homology 1 (OsFH1) regulates root-hair elongation in rice (Oryza sativa)
