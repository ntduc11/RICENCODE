## Expression information

## Key message
1. __stem__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio
2. __growth__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by OsFMO(t) is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice
3. __leaf__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, the full-length genomic DNA and cDNA of OsFMO(t), a FMO gene that was originally identified from a rolled-leaf mutant in rice, was isolated and cloned from wild type of the rolled-leaf mutant, Spatio-temporal expression analysis using RT-PCR and histochemical analysis for GUS activity revealed that expression of OsFMO(t) was totally absent in the rolled-leaf mutant
4. __leaf__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios, When oscow1 seedlings are grown under low-intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled-leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated
5. __iaa__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsFMO(t) in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid (NAA) were added to the medium, These results suggested that the OsFMO(t) protein is involved in IAA biosynthesis in rice and its overexpression could lead to the malformation of calli, Our results demonstrated that IAA biosynthesis regulated by OsFMO(t) is likely localized and might play an essential role in shaping local IAA concentrations which, in turn, is critical for regulating normal growth and development in rice
6. __root__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios, Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio, Thus, our observations suggest that OsCOW1-mediated IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in maintaining root to shoot ratios and, in turn, affects water homeostasis in rice
7. __shoot__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  Homozygous plants with either a Tos17 or T-DNA-inserted allele of OsCOW1 exhibit phenotypes of rolled leaves, reduced leaf widths, and lower root to shoot ratios, Furthermore, a lower turgor potential and transpiration rate in their mature leaves indicates that oscow1 plants are water-deficient, due to insufficient water uptake that possibly stems from that diminished root to shoot ratio, Thus, our observations suggest that OsCOW1-mediated IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in maintaining root to shoot ratios and, in turn, affects water homeostasis in rice
8. __seedling__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  When oscow1 seedlings are grown under low-intensity light and high relative humidity, the rolled-leaf phenotype is greatly alleviated
9. __auxin__, [Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning, characterization and expression of OsFMO(t) in rice encoding a flavin monooxygenase%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of OsFMO(t) in transformed rice calli produced IAA-excessive phenotypes that showed browning and lethal effects when exogenous auxins such as naphthylacetic acid (NAA) were added to the medium
10. __homeostasis__, [Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutively wilted 1, a member of the rice YUCCA gene family, is required for maintaining water homeostasis and an appropriate root to shoot ratio%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, our observations suggest that OsCOW1-mediated IAA biosynthesis plays an important role in maintaining root to shoot ratios and, in turn, affects water homeostasis in rice
