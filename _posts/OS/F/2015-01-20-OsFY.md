## Connection
1. __FCA~OsFCA__, __OsFY__, [OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)), FCA and FY are flowering time related genes involved in the autonomous flowering pathway in Arabidopsis, FCA interacts with FY to regulate the alternative processing of FCA pre-mRNA, The FCA/FY interaction is also required for the regulation of FLC expression, a major floral repressor in Arabidopsis, The protein-protein interaction between OsFY and OsFCA-gamma, the key feature of their gene function, was also demonstrated using the yeast two-hybrid system, These results indicate that the autonomous flowering pathway is present in monocots, and the regulation through FY and FCA interaction is conserved between monocots and dicots,OsFY, a Homolog of AtFY, Encodes a Protein that Can Interact with OsFCA-γ in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
