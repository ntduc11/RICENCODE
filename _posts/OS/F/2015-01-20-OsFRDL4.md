## Key message
1. __transporter__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
2. __xylem__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap
3. __Al tolerance__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance, Knockout of OsFRDL4 resulted in decreased Al tolerance and decreased citrate secretion compared with the wild-type rice, but did not affect citrate concentration in the xylem sap, Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between OsFRDL4 expression level and the amount of citrate secretion in rice cultivars that are differing in Al tolerance, Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
4. __root__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression level of the OsFRDL4 gene in roots was very low in the absence of Al, but was greatly enhanced by Al after short exposure, Immunostaining showed that OsFRDL4 was localized in all cells in the root tip, Taken together, our results show that OsFRDL4 is an Al-induced citrate transporter localized at the plasma membrane of rice root cells and is one of the components of high Al tolerance in rice
5. __transcription factor__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance

## Connection
1. __ART1__, __OsFRDL4__, [An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An Al-inducible MATE gene is involved in external detoxification of Al in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the OsFRDL4 expression was regulated by ART1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcription factor for Al tolerance
