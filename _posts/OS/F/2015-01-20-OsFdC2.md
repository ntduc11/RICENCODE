## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsFdC2 was expressed most abundantly in leaves and its encoded protein was targeted to the chloroplast
2. __map-based cloning__, [Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning of this mutant resulted in identification of OsFdC2 gene (LOC_Os03g48040) showing high identity with Arabidopsis FdC2 gene (AT1G32550)
3. __leaf__, [Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Mutation of FdC2 gene encoding a ferredoxin-like protein with C-terminal extension causes yellow-green leaf phenotype in rice
