## Key message
1. __temperature__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)), " Furthermore, OsFAD2 enhanced tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice at the vegetative stage, These results indicated that OsFAD2 is involved in fatty acid desaturation and maintenance of the membrane lipids balance in cells, and could improve the tolerance of yeast and rice to low temperature stress"
2. __cold tolerance__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)), " Heterologous expression of OsFAD2 enhanced the yeast cells cold tolerance capacity compared to wild-type yeast, More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions"
3. __vegetative__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsFAD2 enhanced tolerance to low temperature when overexpressed in rice at the vegetative stage
4. __yield__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions
5. __reproductive__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions
6. __grain__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  More importantly, the 35S::OsFAD2 plants showed significantly enhanced cold tolerance at the reproductive stage, increasing grain yield by 46% over controls in the greenhouse under cold conditions

8. __growth__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, when the OsFAD2 gene was transferred into an Arabidopsis thaliana fad2-1 mutant, it effectively restored wild-type fatty acid composition and growth characteristics
9. __root__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsFAD2 mRNA accumulated in leaf mesophyll cells and in root epidermis cells when exposed to 15°C for 4 days in dark conditions
10. __leaf__, [A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice microsomal delta-12 fatty acid desaturase can enhance resistance to cold stress in yeast and Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization showed that OsFAD2 mRNA accumulated in leaf mesophyll cells and in root epidermis cells when exposed to 15°C for 4 days in dark conditions
