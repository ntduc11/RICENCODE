## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development
2. __seed development__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)), The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice
3. __cell cycle__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation
4. __leaf__, [Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytochrome B control of total leaf area and stomatal density affects drought tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, phyB mutants exhibited reduced total leaf area per plant, which was probably due to a reduction in the total number of cells per leaf caused by enhanced expression of Orysa;KRP1 and Orysa;KRP4 (encoding inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase complex activity) in the phyB mutants
5. __leaf__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Phenotypic analysis revealed that overexpressed KRP1 reduced cell production during leaf development
6. __endosperm__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells, The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development
7. __seed__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, Orysa;KRP1 overexpression dramatically reduced seed filling, Sectioning through the overexpressed KRP1 seeds showed that KRP overproduction disturbed the production of endosperm cells, The decrease in the number of fully formed seeds was accompanied by a drop in the endoreduplication of endosperm cells, pointing toward a role of KRP1 in connecting endocycle with endosperm development, Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation,The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice
8. __grain__, [The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in seed development of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Also, spatial and temporal transcript detection in developing seeds suggests that Orysa;KRP1 plays an important role in the exit from the mitotic cell cycle during rice grain formation
