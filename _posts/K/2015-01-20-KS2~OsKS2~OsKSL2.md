## Key message
1. __floral__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
2. __ ga __, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The putative OsKS2 gene was a chromosome 4-located ent-kaurene synthase (KS), encoding the enzyme that catalyses an early step of the GA biosynthesis pathway
3. __dwarf__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene, We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants, Further investigation on OsKS2 and other OsKS-like proteins is underway and may yield better understanding of the putative role of OsKS in severe dwarf mutants
4. __gibberellin__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Reverse transcription PCR analyses of 22 candidate genes related to the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway revealed that among 22 candidate genes tested, a dwarf mutant transcript was not expressed only in one OsKS2 gene
5. __stem__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression pattern of OsKS2 in wild-type cv Dongjin, showed that it is expressed in all organs, most prominently in the stem and floral organs
6. __growth__, [Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and characterisation of a dwarf rice mutant exhibiting defective gibberellins biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that dwarfism in this mutant is caused by a point mutation in OsKS2, which plays a significant role in growth and development of higher plants
