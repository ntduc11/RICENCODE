## Information
__Symbol__: Kala4  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os04g47059](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os04g47059)  
__RAPdb__: [Os04g0557500](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os04g0557500)  

## Publication
1. [The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant Cell.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Here, we show that the black grain trait originated from ectopic expression of the Kala4 bHLH gene due to rearrangement in the promoter region  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __grain__, [The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that the black grain trait originated from ectopic expression of the Kala4 bHLH gene due to rearrangement in the promoter region

## Connection
1. __Kala4__, __Rc~qSD7-1~qPC7__, [The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Birth of a Black Rice Gene and Its Local Spread by Introgression.%5BTitle%5D)),  Both the Rc and Kala4 genes activate upstream flavonol biosynthesis genes, such as chalcone synthase and dihydroflavonol-4-reductase, and downstream genes, such as leucoanthocyanidin reductase and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase, to produce the respective specific pigments
