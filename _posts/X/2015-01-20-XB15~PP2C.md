## Connection
1. __xa21__, __XB15~PP2C__, [Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity%5BTitle%5D)),  A yeast two-hybrid screen using the intracellular portion of XA21, including the juxtamembrane (JM) and kinase domain as bait, identified a protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), called XA21 binding protein 15 (XB15), The interaction of XA21 and XB15 was confirmed in vitro and in vivo by glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, respectively, Autophosphorylated XA21 can be dephosphorylated by XB15 in a temporal- and dosage-dependent manner, A serine residue in the XA21 JM domain is required for XB15 binding, Xb15 mutants display a severe cell death phenotype, induction of pathogenesis-related genes, and enhanced XA21-mediated resistance, Overexpression of Xb15 in an XA21 rice line compromises resistance to the bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv, These results demonstrate that Xb15 encodes a PP2C that negatively regulates the XA21-mediated innate immune response,Rice XB15, a protein phosphatase 2C, negatively regulates cell death and XA21-mediated innate immunity
