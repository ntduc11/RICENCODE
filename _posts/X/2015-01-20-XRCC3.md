1. __growth__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
2. __sterility__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
3. __vegetative__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
4. __meiosis__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, the results suggest that XRCC3 plays critical roles in both DSB repair and homologous chromosome recombination during rice meiosis
5. __male sterility__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  The rice xrcc3 mutant exhibited normal vegetative growth but complete male and female sterility
