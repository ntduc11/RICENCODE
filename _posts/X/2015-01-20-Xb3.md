## Connection
1. __xa21__, __Xb3__, [Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice XA21 binding protein 3 is a ubiquitin ligase required for full Xa21-mediated disease resistance%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified XA21 binding protein 3 (XB3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a substrate for the XA21 Ser and Thr kinase, The interaction between XB3 and the kinase domain of XA21 has been shown in yeast and in vitro, and the physical association between XB3 and XA21 in vivo has also been confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation assays, XB3 contains an ankyrin repeat domain and a RING finger motif that is sufficient for its interaction with the kinase domain of XA21 and for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, respectively, Furthermore, reduced levels of Xb3 lead to decreased levels of the XA21 protein, These results indicate that Xb3 is necessary for full accumulation of the XA21 protein and for Xa21-mediated resistance
