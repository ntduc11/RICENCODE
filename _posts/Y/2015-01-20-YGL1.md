## Expression information

## Key message
1. __seedling__, [A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings
2. __leaf__, [A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl-deficient mutant, yellow-green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow-green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development
3. __chloroplast__, [A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A chlorophyll-deficient rice mutant with impaired chlorophyllide esterification in chlorophyll biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, a rice (Oryza Sativa) Chl-deficient mutant, yellow-green leaf1 (ygl1), was isolated, which showed yellow-green leaves in young plants with decreased Chl synthesis, increased level of tetrapyrrole intermediates, and delayed chloroplast development, Moreover, the expression of some nuclear genes associated with Chl biosynthesis or chloroplast development was also affected in ygl1 seedlings
