17. __D14L__, __HTD2~D88~D14__, [Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Downregulation of Rice DWARF 14 LIKE Suppress Mesocotyl Elongation via a Strigolactone Independent Pathway in the Dark.%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that D14L and D14 confer their effects via an SL independent pathway and an SL signaling pathway respectively
