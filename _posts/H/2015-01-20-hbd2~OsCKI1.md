## Key message
1. __adventitious root__, [Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity%5BTitle%5D)),  The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation, Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels
2. __brassinosteroid__, [Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity%5BTitle%5D)),  A rice cDNA fragment encoding a putative casein kinase I (CKI) was identified via cDNA macroarray under brassinosteroid (BR) treatment, and a 1939-bp full-length cDNA, OsCKI1, was isolated and found to encode a putative 463-aa protein
3. __root development__, [Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity%5BTitle%5D)),  The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation, Interestingly, in transgenic and CKI-7-treated plants, exogenously supplied IAA could restore normal root development, and measurement of free IAA content in CKI-deficient primary and adventitious roots revealed altered auxin content, indicating that OsCKI1 is involved in auxin metabolism or that it may affect auxin levels,Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity

7. __primary root__, [Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Roles of OsCKI1, a rice casein kinase I, in root development and plant hormone sensitivity%5BTitle%5D)),  The physiological roles of OsCKI1 were studied through antisense transgenic approaches, and homozygous transgenic plants showed abnormal root development, including fewer lateral and adventitious roots, and shortened primary roots as a result of reduced cell elongation
