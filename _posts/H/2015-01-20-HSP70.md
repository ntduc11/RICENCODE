2. __temperature__, [Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated%5BTitle%5D)), " By contrast, we found that during heat stress the expression of hsp70 correlates well with increases in internal ion concentrations, and can also be induced by excess salt or ethanol at normal growth temperatures"
3. __growth__, [Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Heat-inducible rice hsp82 and hsp70 are not always co-regulated%5BTitle%5D)),  By contrast, we found that during heat stress the expression of hsp70 correlates well with increases in internal ion concentrations, and can also be induced by excess salt or ethanol at normal growth temperatures
