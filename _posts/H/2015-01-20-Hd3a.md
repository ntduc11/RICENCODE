8. __floral__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions, These results indicate that Hd3a and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1 expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification
9. __heading date__, [Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice
