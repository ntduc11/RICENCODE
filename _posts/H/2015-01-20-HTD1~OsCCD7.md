1. __tillering__, [Characterizations and fine mapping of a mutant gene for high tillering and dwarf in rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterizations and fine mapping of a mutant gene for high tillering and dwarf in rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  The genetic analysis of the htd-1 mutant indicated that the phenotypes of high tillering and dwarf were controlled by a recessive gene, termed htd1
2. __root__, [The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds%5BTitle%5D)),  The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues
3. __strigolactone__, [Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification and characterization of HTD2: a novel gene negatively regulating tiller bud outgrowth in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Loss of function of HTD2 resulted in a significantly increased expression of HTD1, D10 and D3, which were involved in the strigolactone biosynthetic pathway
4. __shoot__, [The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds%5BTitle%5D)),  The HTD1 gene is expressed in both shoot and root tissues
5. __vascular bundle__, [The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice HIGH-TILLERING DWARF1 encoding an ortholog of Arabidopsis MAX3 is required for negative regulation of the outgrowth of axillary buds%5BTitle%5D)),  By evaluating Pro(HTD1):GUS expression, we found that the HTD1 gene is mainly expressed in vascular bundle tissues throughout the plant
