71. __Ghd7__, __Hd1__, [Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning demonstrated that the gene largely affecting the interaction between Ghd7 and Ghd8 was Hd1
72. __Ghd7__, __Hd1__, [Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Natural variation analysis showed that a combination of loss-of-function alleles of Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 contributes to the expansion of rice cultivars to higher latitudes; by contrast, a combination of pre-existing strong alleles of Ghd7, Ghd8 and functional Hd1 (referred as SSF) is exclusively found where ancestral Asian cultivars originated
73. __Ghd7__, __Hd1__, [Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Combinations of the Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 genes largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential of cultivated rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results indicate that the combinations of Ghd7, Ghd8 and Hd1 largely define the ecogeographical adaptation and yield potential in rice cultivars
74. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify a C3HC4 RING domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, Heading date Associated Factor 1 (HAF1), which physically interacts with Hd1
75. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  HAF1 mediates ubiquitination and targets Hd1 for degradation via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway
76. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the haf1 hd1 double mutant headed as late as hd1 plants under short-day conditions but exhibited a heading date similar to haf1 under long-day conditions, thus indicating that HAF1 may determine heading date mainly through Hd1 under short-day conditions
77. __Hd1__, __OsHIP1~HAF1__, [The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The RING-Finger Ubiquitin Ligase HAF1 Mediates Heading date 1 Degradation during Photoperiodic Flowering in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, high levels of Hd1 accumulate in haf1
