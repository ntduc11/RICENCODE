## Connection
1. __RH1__, __RH2__, [A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation%5BTitle%5D)),  We identified three NRR homologues (RH1, RH2, and RH3), RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation, NRR, RH1, RH2, and RH3 share sequence similarity in a region beyond the previously identified NPR1-interacting domain, RH2 carries a deviation (amino acids AV) in this region as compared to consensus sequences (amino acids ED) among NRR, RH1, and RH3
2. __OsNPR1~NH1__, __RH1__, [A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice transient assay system identifies a novel domain in NRR required for interaction with NH1/OsNPR1 and inhibition of NH1-mediated transcriptional activation%5BTitle%5D)),  RH1 and RH3, but not RH2, also effectively repress NH1-mediated transcriptional activation, NRR, RH1, RH2, and RH3 share sequence similarity in a region beyond the previously identified NPR1-interacting domain
