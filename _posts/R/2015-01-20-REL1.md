## Publication
1. [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, J Exp Bot.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending  
__OverExpression__: Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending  
__RNAi__:  

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Electron microscope observations indicated that the leaf incurvations of rel1 dominant mutants result from the alteration of the size and number of bulliform cells
2. __leaf__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending
3. __leaf__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these findings suggest that REL1 regulates leaf morphology, particularly in leaf rolling and bending, through the coordination of BR signalling transduction
4. __growth__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development
5. __development__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development
6. __meristem__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development
7. __brassinosteroid__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Nevertheless, the responsiveness of both rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing plants to exogenous brassinosteroid (BR) was reduced
8. __ BR __, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, transcript levels of BR response genes in the rel1 dominant mutants and REL1-overexpressing lines were significantly altered
9. __ BR __, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, these findings suggest that REL1 regulates leaf morphology, particularly in leaf rolling and bending, through the coordination of BR signalling transduction
10. __plant growth__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with the observed rel1 phenotype, the REL1 gene was predominantly expressed in the meristem of various tissues during plant growth and development
11. __leaf rolling__, [Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of Rolled and Erect Leaf 1 in regulating leave morphology in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Alternatively, overexpression of REL1 in wild-type plants induced a phenotype similar to that of the dominant rel1 mutant, indicating that REL1 plays a positive role in leaf rolling and bending
