## Expression information

## Key message
1. __mitochondria__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  A study of subcellular localization demonstrated that only RIF2 was targeted to mitochondria
2. __fertility__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
3. __Ubiquitin__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  RIF2 encodes ubiquitin domain-containing protein

## Connection
1. __Rf2__, __RIF2__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  coli-produced recombinant GST-tagged RF2 and His-tagged RIF2 confirmed that RF2 interacted with RIF2
2. __Rf2__, __RIF2__, [A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A candidate factor that interacts with RF2, a restorer of fertility of Lead rice-type cytoplasmic male sterility in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), These results suggest that RIF2 is a candidate factor of a fertility restoration complex of RF2
