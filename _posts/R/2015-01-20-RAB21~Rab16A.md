2. __seed__, [Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  The Rab16A transcript also increased gradually with seed maturity, with its maximal accumulation at 30 d after pollination (DAP) i,, fully matured seeds, explaining the protective role of Rab16A gene during seed maturation
3. __salt__, [Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)), "We report here the overexpression of Rab16A full length gene (promoter + ORF), from the salt-tolerant indica rice Pokkali, in the salt-susceptible indica rice variety Khitish, via particle bombardment,Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance"
4. __salinity__, [Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  Enhanced tolerance to salinity was observed in the plants transformed with Rab16A, All these results indicated that the overproduction of RAB16A protein in the transgenics enable them to display enhanced tolerance to salinity stress with improved physiological traits
5. __salinity stress__, [Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of Rab16A gene in indica rice variety for generating enhanced salt tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  All these results indicated that the overproduction of RAB16A protein in the transgenics enable them to display enhanced tolerance to salinity stress with improved physiological traits
