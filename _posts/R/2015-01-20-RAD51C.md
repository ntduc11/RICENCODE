## Key message
1. __meiosis__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells,The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells
2. __fertility__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Transferring RAD51C to the RAD51C-KO line restored fertility
3. __reproductive__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RAD51C is essential for reproductive development by regulating meiosis as well as for DNA damage repair in somatic cells
4. __anther__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
5. __mitosis__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
6. __pollen__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
7. __meiotic__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)
8. __vegetative__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  The RAD51C-KO line showed no obvious difference from wild-type plants in mitosis in the anther wall cells, which was consistent with the observation that the RAD51C-KO line did not have obviously abnormal morphology during vegetative development
9. __sterility__, [The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice RAD51C gene is required for the meiosis of both female and male gametocytes and the DNA repair of somatic cells%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockout (KO) of RAD51C resulted in both female and male sterility in rice, Cytological analyses showed that the sterility of RAD51C-KO plants was associated with abnormal early meiotic processes in both megasporocytes and pollen mother cells (PMCs)

## Connection
1. __RAD51C__, __XRCC3__, [XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XRCC3 is essential for proper double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in rice meiosis.%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, abnormal chromosome localization of RAD51C, DMC1, ZEP1, ZIP4, and MER3 was observed in xrcc3
