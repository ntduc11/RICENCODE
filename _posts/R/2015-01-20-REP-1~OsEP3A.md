## Key message
1. __seedling__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
2. __gibberellin__, [Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of the gene for REP-1 (Rep1) is induced by gibberellins (GAs) and repressed by abscisic acid (ABA)
3. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
4. __seed__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice, The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells, Histochemical studies also indicate that the OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer the hormonal regulation of GUS expression in germinating seeds
5. __growth__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice (Oryza sativa), REP-1 is a primary cysteine proteinase responsible for the digestion of seed storage proteins to provide nutrients to support the growth of young seedlings
6. __vegetative__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  An OsEP3A-specific DNA probe was used to study the effect of various factors on the expression of OsEP3A in germinating seeds and vegetative tissues of rice, The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells
7. __seed__, [Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Two cis-acting elements necessary and sufficient for gibberellin-upregulated proteinase expression in rice seeds%5BTitle%5D)), In germinating rice seeds, a cysteine proteinase (REP-1), synthesized in aleurone-layer cells, is a key enzyme in the degradation of the major storage protein, glutelin
8. __nitrogen__, [Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Multiple mode regulation of a cysteine proteinase gene expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsEP3A is hormonally regulated in germinating seeds, spatially and temporally regulated in vegetative tissues, and nitrogen-regulated in suspension-cultured cells, The OsEP3A promoter is sufficient to confer nitrogen regulation of GUS expression in suspension-cultured cells
