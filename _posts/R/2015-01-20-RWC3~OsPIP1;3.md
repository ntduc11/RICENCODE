## Expression information

## Key message
1. __ethylene__, [The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of water channel protein RWC3 mRNA was increased in upland rice at the early response (up to 4 h) to the 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 treatment, whereas there was no significant expression changes in lowland rice
2. __seed__, [The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions, Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination, Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
3. __drought__, [The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The up-regulation of RWC3 in upland rice fits well with the knowledge that upland rice adopts the mechanism of drought avoidance, These results indicated that RWC3 probably played a role in drought avoidance in rice,The role of aquaporin RWC3 in drought avoidance in rice
4. __seed germination__, [The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Partial silencing of the water channel genes, OsPIP1;1 and OsPIP1;3, reduced seed germination while over-expression of OsPIP1;3 promoted seed germination under water-stress conditions, Moreover, spatial expression analysis indicates that OsPIP1;3 is expressed predominantly in embryo during seed germination

## Connection

2. __OsPIP1;2__, __RWC3~OsPIP1;3__, [The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of water channel proteins and nitric oxide signaling in rice seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Exogenous NO stimulated the transcription of OsPIP1;1, OsPIP1;2, OsPIP1;3 and OsPIP2;8 in germinating seeds
3. __LP2__, __RWC3~OsPIP1;3__, [Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Plasma membrane receptor-like kinase leaf panicle 2 acts downstream of the DROUGHT AND SALT TOLERANCE transcription factor to regulate drought sensitivity in rice%5BTitle%5D)), In addition, LP2 was identified as a functional kinase localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with the drought-responsive aquaporin proteins OsPIP1; 1, OsPIP1; 3, and OsPIP2; 3.
