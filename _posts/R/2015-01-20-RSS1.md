## Key message
1. __starch biosynthesis__, [Cloning and expression of rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose synthase 1 (RSs1) in developing seed endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Cloning and expression of rice (Oryza sativa) sucrose synthase 1 (RSs1) in developing seed endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  No correlation between sucrose synthase activity and starch biosynthesis was seen in these mutants, although slight elevations of RSs1 transcript levels were observed
2. __meristem__, [Molecular characterization of the rice protein RSS1 required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of the rice protein RSS1 required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously showed that the rice protein RSS1, whose stability is regulated depending on the cell cycle phases, is a key factor for the maintenance of meristematic activity under stressful conditions,Molecular characterization of the rice protein RSS1 required for meristematic activity under stressful conditions
