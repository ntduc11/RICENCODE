## Information
__Symbol__: RAV6  
__MSU__: [LOC_Os02g45850](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/ORF_infopage.cgi?orf=LOC_Os02g45850)  
__RAPdb__: [Os02g0683500](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/viewer/gbrowse_details/irgsp1?name=Os02g0683500)  

## Publication
1. [Epigenetic Mutation of RAV6 Affects Leaf Angle and Seed Size in Rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Epigenetic Mutation of RAV6 Affects Leaf Angle and Seed Size in Rice.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Plant Physiol.

## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Instead, we found hypomethylation in the promoter region of RAV6, which caused ectopic expression of RAV6 in Epi-rav6 plants |  Bisulfite analysis revealed that cytosine methylation of 4 CG and 2 CNG loci within a continuous 96-bp region plays essential roles in regulating RAV6 expression; this region contains a conserved MITE transposon insertion in cultivated rice genomes |  Overexpression of RAV6 in wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype  
__OverExpression__: Overexpression of RAV6 in wild type phenocopied the Epi-rav6 phenotype  
__RNAi__:
