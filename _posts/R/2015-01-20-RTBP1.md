## Key message

3. __vegetative__, [Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  rtbp1 plants displayed progressive and severe developmental abnormalities in both germination and postgermination growth of vegetative organs over four generations (G1 to G4), Furthermore, 35S:anti-RTBP1 plants expressing lower levels of RTBP1 mRNA exhibited developmental phenotypes intermediate between the wild type and mutants in all aspects examined, including telomere length, vegetative and reproductive growth, and degree of genomic anomaly
4. __architecture__, [Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Suppression of RICE TELOMERE BINDING PROTEIN 1 results in severe and gradual developmental defects accompanied by genome instability in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that RTBP1 plays dual roles in rice (Oryza sativa), as both a negative regulator of telomere length and one of positive and functional components for proper architecture of telomeres
