## Key message
1. __grain size__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
2. __grain yield__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice
3. __transcriptional regulator__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a dominant QTL, GRAIN SIZE ON CHROMOSOME 2 (GS2), which encodes Growth-Regulating Factor 4 (OsGRF4), a transcriptional regulator.
4. __transcription activator__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), GS2 localizes to the nucleus and may act as a transcription activator.
5. __grain weight__, [A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rare allele of GS2 enhances grain size and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The increase of GS2 expression leads to larger cells and increased numbers of cells, which thus enhances grain weight and yield.

## Connection
1. __GS2~OsGRF4__, __OSH71~Oskn2__, [Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Interaction between the GROWTH-REGULATING FACTOR and KNOTTED1-LIKE HOMEOBOX families of transcription factors.%5BTitle%5D)),  Conversely, RNA interference silencing of OsGRF3, OsGRF4, and OsGRF5 resulted in dwarfism, delayed growth and inflorescence formation, and up-regulation of Oskn2
