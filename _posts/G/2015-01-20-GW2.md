## Expression information
__Expression__: To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level |  The results clearly showed that qSW5 and GW2 positively regulate the expression of GS3 |  Additionally, GIF1 expression was found to be positively regulated by qSW5 but negatively by GW2 and GS3  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__: To shade light on the relationship of above four genes, gene expression analysis was performed with GS3-RNAi, GW2-RNAi lines and CSSL of qSW5 at the transcriptional level
