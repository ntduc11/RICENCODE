## Key message
1. __seed__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  Phenotypic analyses revealed that gnt1 shows defective post-seedling development and incomplete cell wall biosynthesis, leading to symptoms such as failure in tiller formation, brittle leaves, reduced cell wall thickness, and decreased cellulose content, However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress
2. __reproductive__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)),  The developmental defects of gnt1 ultimately resulted in early lethality without transition to the reproductive stage
3. __salt__, [N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(N-glycan maturation is crucial for cytokinin-mediated development and cellulose synthesis in Oryza sativa%5BTitle%5D)), " However, callus induced from gnt1 seeds could be maintained for periods, although it exhibited a low proliferation rate, small size, and hypersensitivity to salt stress"
