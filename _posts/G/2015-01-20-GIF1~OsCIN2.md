## Key message
1. __domestication__, [Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously demonstrated that the rice cell-wall invertase (CWI) gene GIF1 that plays an important role in the grain-filling process was most likely subjected to domestication selection in the promoter region, Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region,Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication
2. __grain__, [Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we report the isolation and functional analysis of the rice GIF1 (GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1) gene that encodes a cell-wall invertase required for carbon partitioning during early grain-filling, The cultivated GIF1 gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain-filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene's regulatory sequence through domestication, Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice GIF1 is responsible for grain weight reduction, Ectopic expression of the cultivated GIF1 gene with the 35S or rice Waxy promoter resulted in smaller grains, whereas overexpression of GIF1 driven by its native promoter increased grain production
3. __homeostasis__, [Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Taken together, our study reveals that sugar homeostasis mediated by GIF1 plays an important role in constitutive and induced physical and chemical defence,Sugar homeostasis mediated by cell wall invertase GRAIN INCOMPLETE FILLING 1 (GIF1) plays a role in pre-existing and induced defence in rice
4. __domestication__, [Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  The cultivated GIF1 gene shows a restricted expression pattern during grain-filling compared to the wild rice allele, probably a result of accumulated mutations in the gene's regulatory sequence through domestication, These findings, together with the domestication signature that we identified by comparing nucleotide diversity of the GIF1 loci between cultivated and wild rice, strongly suggest that GIF1 is a potential domestication gene and that such a domestication-selected gene can be used for further crop improvement
5. __grain weight__, [Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of rice grain-filling and yield by a gene with a potential signature of domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Fine mapping with introgression lines revealed that the wild rice GIF1 is responsible for grain weight reduction

1. __GIF1~OsCIN2__, __OsCIN1__, [Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report that GIF1 and another CWI gene OsCIN1 constitute a pair of duplicate genes with differentiated expression and function through independent selection, RESULTS: Through synteny analysis, we show that GIF1 and another cell-wall invertase gene OsCIN1 were paralogues derived from a segmental duplication originated during genome duplication of grasses, Results based on analyses of population genetics and gene phylogenetic tree of 25 cultivars and 25 wild rice sequences demonstrated that OsCIN1 was also artificially selected during rice domestication with a fixed mutation in the coding region, in contrast to GIF1 that was selected in the promoter region, GIF1 and OsCIN1 have evolved into different expression patterns and probable different kinetics parameters of enzymatic activity with the latter displaying less enzymatic activity, Overexpression of GIF1 and OsCIN1 also resulted in different phenotypes, suggesting that OsCIN1 might regulate other unrecognized biological process, Our discovery that the duplicated pair of GIF1 and OsCIN1 has experienced sub-functionalization implies that selection could act independently on each duplicate towards different functional specificity, which provides a vivid example for evolution of genetic novelties in a model crop,Duplication and independent selection of cell-wall invertase genes GIF1 and OsCIN1 during rice evolution and domestication
