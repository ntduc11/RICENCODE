## Genbank accession number

## Expression information
__Expression__: Map-based cloning reveals that DTH7 encodes a pseudo-response regulator protein and its expression is regulated by photoperiod |  We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering  
__OverExpression__:  
__RNAi__:
