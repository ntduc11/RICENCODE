9. __panicle__, [Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the Gnp4 and Lax1-1 double mutant showed dramatically reduced secondary branches and spikelets in panicle at reproductive stage, and tillers at vegetative stage,Fine Mapping and Cloning of the Grain Number Per-Panicle Gene (Gnp4) on Chromosome 4 in Rice (Oryza sativa L.)
10. __panicle__, [LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we characterized the rice (Oryza sativa) lax panicle2 (lax2) mutant, which has altered AM formation, LAX2 regulates the branching of the aboveground parts of a rice plant throughout plant development, except for the primary branch in the panicle, The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage

## Connection
1. __Gnp4~LAX2__, __LAX1__, [LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LAX PANICLE2 of rice encodes a novel nuclear protein and regulates the formation of axillary meristems%5BTitle%5D)),  The lax2 mutant is similar to lax panicle1 (lax1) in that it lacks an AM in most of the lateral branching of the panicle and has a reduced number of AMs at the vegetative stage, The lax1 lax2 double mutant synergistically enhances the reduced-branching phenotype, indicating the presence of multiple pathways for branching, LAX2 encodes a nuclear protein that contains a plant-specific conserved domain and physically interacts with LAX1, We propose that LAX2 is a novel factor that acts together with LAX1 in rice to regulate the process of AM formation
