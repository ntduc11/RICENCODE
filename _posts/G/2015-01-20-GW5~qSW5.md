1. __cell division__, [Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight%5BTitle%5D)),  Together, our results suggest that GW5 represents a major QTL underlying rice width and weight, and that it likely acts in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to regulate cell division during seed development
2. __grain width__, [Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight%5BTitle%5D)),  We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5, To gain a better understanding of how GW5 controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24,Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight
3. __flower__, [Deletion in a gene associated with grain size increased yields during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Deletion in a gene associated with grain size increased yields during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Through fine mapping, complementation testing and association analysis, we found that a deletion in qSW5 resulted in a significant increase in sink size owing to an increase in cell number in the outer glume of the rice flower; this trait might have been selected by ancient humans to increase yield of rice grains
4. __grain__, [Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight%5BTitle%5D)),  We earlier identified a major QTL that controls rice grain width and weight, GW5, which was mapped to a recombination hotspot on rice chromosome 5, To gain a better understanding of how GW5 controls rice grain width, we conducted fine mapping of this locus and uncovered a 1 212-bp deletion associated with the increased grain width in the rice cultivar Asominori, in comparison with the slender grain rice IR24, In addition, genotyping analyses of 46 rice cultivars revealed that this deletion is highly correlated with the grain-width phenotype, suggesting that the GW5 deletion might have been selected during rice domestication, This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms controlling rice grain development and suggests that GW5 could serve as a potential tool for high-yield breeding of crops,Isolation and initial characterization of GW5, a major QTL associated with rice grain width and weight
