## Expression information
__Expression__:Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice. |  Overexpression of OsHMA3 selectively reduces Cd accumulation in the grain |  Further characterization in the present study revealed that overexpression of OsHMA3 also enhances the tolerance to toxic Cd |  The overexpressed line showed higher Cd concentration in the roots, but lower Cd concentration in the shoots compared with the wild-type rice and vector control line, indicating that overexpression of OsHMA3 enhanced vacuolar sequestration of Cd in the roots |  Taken together, overexpression of OsHMA3 is an efficient way to reduce Cd accumulation in the grain and to enhance Cd tolerance in rice
