## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shattering__, [Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
2. __shattering__, [An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation
3. __seed__, [An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An SNP caused loss of seed shattering during rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  We revealed that the qSH1 gene, a major quantitative trait locus of seed shattering in rice, encodes a BEL1-type homeobox gene and demonstrated that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' regulatory region of the qSH1 gene caused loss of seed shattering owing to the absence of abscission layer formation

## Connection
1. __qSH1__, __sh4~SHA1__, [Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Selection on grain shattering genes and rates of rice domestication%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we studied nucleotide variation at the shattering loci, sh4 and qSH1, for cultivated rice, Oryza sativa ssp
2. __qSH1__, __SH5__, [The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The BEL1-type homeobox gene SH5 induces seed shattering by enhancing abscission-zone development and inhibiting lignin biosynthesis%5BTitle%5D)), Os05 g38120 (SH5) on chromosome 5 is highly homologous to qSH1
