## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain quality__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
2. __grain size__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield,Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice
3. __yield__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield
4. __grain__, [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of GS3 and OsSPL16 underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield,Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice

## Connection
1. __GW7~GL7__, __qGW8~OsSPL16~GW8__, [The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The OsSPL16-GW7 regulatory module determines grain shape and simultaneously improves rice yield and grain quality.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsSPL16 (GW8), an SBP-domain transcription factor that regulates grain width, bound directly to the GW7 promoter and repressed its expression
