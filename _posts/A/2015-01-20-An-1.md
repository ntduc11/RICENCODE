## Key message
1. __grains per panicle__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The nearly-isogenic line (NIL-An-1) carrying a wild allele An-1 in the genetic background of the awnless indica Guangluai4 produces long awns and longer grains, but significantly fewer grains per panicle compared with Guangluai4
2. __grain yield__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice
3. __grain number__, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle, Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice,An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice
4. __ awn __, [An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the molecular cloning of a major quantitative trait locus, An-1, which regulates long awn formation in O, Transgenic studies confirmed that An-1 positively regulates awn elongation, but negatively regulates grain number per panicle, Genetic variations in the An-1 locus were found to be associated with awn loss in cultivated rice, Thus, we propose that awn loss was favored and strongly selected by humans, as genetic variations at the An-1 locus that cause awn loss would increase grain numbers and subsequently improve grain yield in cultivated rice,An-1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that regulates awn development, grain size, and grain number in rice
