## Key message
1. __seed__, [Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Structural organization and differential expression of rice alpha-amylase genes%5BTitle%5D)),  RAmy1A and RAmy3E were expressed in all tissues while RAmy3D was expressed in all tissues except the immature seeds, RAmy1A transcript was most abundant in the germinating seeds, while RAmy3D and RAmy3E transcripts were most abundant in callus and immature seeds, respectively
