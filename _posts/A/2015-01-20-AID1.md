## Key message
1. __flower__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
2. __pollen__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
3. __panicle__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  AID1 was expressed in both the leaves and panicles of wild-type plants, but not in mutant plants
4. __spikelet__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility, Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
5. __grain__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
6. __tiller__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, aid1 mutant plants had fewer tillers and flowered 10 to 15 d later than the wild type
7. __anther__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility, Spikelets of the aid1 mutant could be classified into three types based on the viability of pollen grains and the extent of anther dehiscence
8. __sterility__, [The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ANTHER INDEHISCENCE1 gene encoding a single MYB domain protein is involved in anther development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  cv Nipponbare) recessive mutant, anther indehiscence1 (aid1), showing partial to complete spikelet sterility
