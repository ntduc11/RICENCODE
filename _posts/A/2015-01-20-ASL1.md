## Key message
1. __chloroplast__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D)),  Map-based cloning revealed that ASL1 encodes PRP S20 (PRPS20), which localizes to the chloroplast, The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
2. __photosynthesis__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcript levels of nuclear genes for Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development were strongly affected in asl1 mutants; transcripts of some plastid genes for photosynthesis were undetectable
3. __seedling__, [Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Disruption of the rice plastid ribosomal protein s20 leads to chloroplast developmental defects and seedling lethality%5BTitle%5D)),  This study identifies the first rice PRP mutant, asl1 (albino seedling lethality1), which exhibits an albino lethal phenotype at the seedling stage, ASL1 showed tissue-specific expression, as it was highly expressed in plumule and young seedlings but expressed at much lower levels in other tissues
