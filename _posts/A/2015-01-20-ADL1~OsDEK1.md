## Expression information

## Key message
1. __leaf__, [The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves, An adl1 double mutant with the adaxially snowy leaf mutant, which has albino cells that specifically appear in the abaxial mesophyll tissue, indicated that adl1 leaves show adaxialization in both epidermal and mesophyll tissues, This indicated that ADL1 may not be directly involved in determining initial leaf polarity, but rather is associated with the maintenance of axis information, We propose that ADL1 plays an important role in pattern formation of the leaf and embryo by promoting proper epidermal development
2. __leaf development__, [The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To understand axis information in leaf development, we isolated the adaxialized leaf1 (adl1) mutant in rice, which forms abaxially rolled leaves
3. __shoot__, [The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ADAXIALIZED LEAF1 gene functions in leaf and embryonic pattern formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, we identified intermediate and strong alleles of the adl1 mutant that generate shootless embryos and globular-arrested embryos with aleurone layer loss, respectively

## Connection
1. __ADL1~OsDEK1__, __OsCR4__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
2. __ADL1~OsDEK1__, __OsSAL1~RHL__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
3. __ADL1~OsDEK1__, __RISBZ1~OsbZIP58__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
4. __ADL1~OsDEK1__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Compensation and interaction between RISBZ1 and RPBF during grain filling in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Gene expression of DEFECTIVE KERNEL1 (OsDEK1), CRINKLY4 (OsCR4) and SUPERNUMERARY ALEURONE LAYER 1 (OsSAL1) rice homologues was decreased in the KD mutants, suggesting that these genes are regulated by RISBZ1 and RPBF
