## Expression information

## Key message
1. __nitrogen__, [Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)),  These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
2. __seed__, [Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Molecular characterization of a gene for alanine aminotransferase from rice (Oryza sativa)%5BTitle%5D)), A cDNA clone encoding alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has isolated from randomly sequenced clones derived from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds by comparison to previously identified genes, These results suggest that AlaAT is involved in nitrogen metabolism during the maturation of rice seed
3. __starch__, [Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D)),  OsAlaAT1 is predominantly expressed in developing seeds during active starch synthesis
4. __starch__, [Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1) plays an essential role in the regulation of starch storage in rice endosperm.%5BTitle%5D)),  Thus, our observations suggest that OsAlaAT1 plays an essential role in starch synthesis in developing seeds that are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen
