## Information
__Symbol__: AChE

## Publication
1. [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.%5BTitle%5D)), 2015, Biochem Biophys Res Commun.

## Genbank accession number
[AK073754](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AK073754)

## Expression information
__Expression__: Next, the functionality of rice AChE was proved by overexpression in rice plants |  Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response  
__OverExpression__: Next, the functionality of rice AChE was proved by overexpression in rice plants |  Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response

## Key message
1. __seedlings__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism.%5BTitle%5D)),  This result clearly suggests that the function of the rice AChE relate to positive regulation of gravitropic response in rice seedlings
2. __acetylcholinesterase__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism
3. __shoot gravitropism__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism
4. __gravitropic response__, [Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of acetylcholinesterase gene in rice results in enhancement of shoot gravitropism%5BTitle%5D)), Finally, by comparing AChE up-regulated plants with wild-type, we found that AChE overexpression causes an enhanced gravitropic response.
