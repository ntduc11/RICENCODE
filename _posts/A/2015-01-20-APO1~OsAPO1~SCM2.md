1. __vegetative__, [ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 temporally regulates meristem identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 temporally regulates meristem identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Vegetative development is also affected in the apo1, Leaves were formed rapidly throughout the vegetative phase, indicating that APO1 is also involved in temporal regulation of leaf production, These phenotypes suggest that the APO1 plays an important role in the temporal regulation of both vegetative and reproductive development
2. __floral__, [Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously reported that the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets
3. __panicle__, [New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield%5BTitle%5D)),  Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure, Although SCM2 is a gain-of-function mutant of APO1, it does not have the negative effects reported for APO1 overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology
4. __floral__, [Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy, Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes, Molecular studies revealed that APO1 encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes

19. __culm__, [New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, using chromosome segment substitution lines, we identified an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for culm strength, which was designated STRONG CULM2 (SCM2), A near-isogenic line carrying SCM2 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene
