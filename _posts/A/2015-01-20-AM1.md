## Key message
1. __seed__, [Albino midrib 1, encoding a putative potassium efflux antiporter, affects chloroplast development and drought tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Albino midrib 1, encoding a putative potassium efflux antiporter, affects chloroplast development and drought tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Interestingly, AM1 was induced by salt and PEG, and am1 showed enhanced sensitivity to salinity in seed germination and increased tolerance to drought
2. __chloroplast__, [Albino midrib 1, encoding a putative potassium efflux antiporter, affects chloroplast development and drought tolerance in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Albino midrib 1, encoding a putative potassium efflux antiporter, affects chloroplast development and drought tolerance in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that AM1 encoded a putative KEA in chloroplast
