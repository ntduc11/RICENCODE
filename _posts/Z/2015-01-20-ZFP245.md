2. __salt__, ["Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"%5BTitle%5D)), " However, ZFP245 was not regulated by high salt or abscisic acid treatment"
3. __drought__, ["Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Identification of a rice zinc finger protein whose expression is transiently induced by drought, cold but not by salinity and abscisic acid"%5BTitle%5D)), " The semi-quantitative-RT-PCR assay revealed ZFP245 was strongly induced after 6 h exposure to cold and drought stresses, and then reduced to the baseline, Taken together, ZFP245, as the first identified C2H2-type zinc finger protein involved in stress response in monocots probably plays a role as a transcription regulator in plant cold and drought responses through an ABA-independent pathway"

5. __abiotic stress__, ["Increased tolerance of rice to cold, drought and oxidative stresses mediated by the overexpression of a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein ZFP245"](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=("Increased tolerance of rice to cold, drought and oxidative stresses mediated by the overexpression of a gene that encodes the zinc finger protein ZFP245"%5BTitle%5D)), " Our data suggest that ZFP245 may contribute to the tolerance of rice plants to cold and drought stresses by regulating proline levels and reactive oxygen species-scavenging activities, and therefore may be useful for developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to abiotic stress"
