## Key message
1. __leaf development__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development
2. __chloroplast__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development, Together, we propose that ZN is required for protecting developing chloroplasts, especially during the assembly of thylakoid protein complexes, from incidental light after darkness
3. __leaf__, [ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZEBRA-NECROSIS, a thylakoid-bound protein, is critical for the photoprotection of developing chloroplasts during early leaf development%5BTitle%5D)),  Virus-induced gene silencing of a ZN homolog in Nicotiana benthamiana causes leaf variegation with sporadic green/yellow sectors, indicating that ZN is essential for chloroplast biogenesis during early leaf development

## Connection
1. __qCdT7~OsHMA3__, __ZN__, [Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.%5BTitle%5D)), Overexpression of OsHMA3 enhances Cd tolerance and expression of Zn transporter genes in rice.
2. __OsPCR1__, __ZN__, [Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice PCR1 influences grain weight and Zn accumulation in grains.%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, the grains of OsPCR1-knockdown lines exhibited substantially higher Zn and lower cadmium (Cd) concentrations than the control, as did yeast heterologously expressing OsPCR1
