## Key message
1. __salt stress__, [Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " The ZFP179 transgenic rice exhibited significantly increased tolerance to oxidative stress, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging ability, and expression levels of a number of stress-related genes, including OsDREB2A, OsP5CS OsProT, and OsLea3 under salt stress, Our studies suggest that ZFP179 plays a crucial role in the plant response to salt stress, and is useful in developing transgenic crops with enhanced tolerance to salt stress"
2. __ ABA __, [Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments
3. __seedling__, [Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional analysis of a novel Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein involved in salt tolerance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Through microarray analysis, a salt-responsive zinc finger protein gene ZFP179 was identified and subsequently cloned from rice seedlings, The real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that ZFP179 was highly expressed in immature spikes, and markedly induced in the seedlings by NaCl, PEG 6000, and ABA treatments, Overexpression of ZFP179 in rice increased salt tolerance and the transgenic seedlings showed hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA
