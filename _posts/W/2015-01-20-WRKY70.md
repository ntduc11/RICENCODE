## Key message
1. __growth__, [Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
2. __gibberellin__, [Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
3. __transcription factor__, [Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
4. __brown planthopper__, [Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, WRKY70 induction increases plant susceptibility against the rice brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens
5. __jasmonic__, [Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Prioritizing plant defence over growth through WRKY regulation facilitates infestation by non-target herbivores.%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identify WRKY70 as a specific herbivore-induced, mitogen-activated protein kinase-regulated rice transcription factor that physically interacts with W-box motives and prioritizes defence over growth by positively regulating jasmonic acid (JA) and negatively regulating gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis upon attack by the chewing herbivore Chilo suppressalis
