RICENCODE
=========

The knowledge of cloned rice genes lost in the information of rice functional genomic studies

We collected 2500 cloned rice genes and 310 gene families comprised of 3691 genes. For each gene, 
various information concerning the gene symbol, the genomic locus in the Nipponbare reference genome, 
the Genbank accession number, the title, journal, year, author affiliation, abstract of related 
publications and the text mining result of the publications were provided.

This database was provided as a shiny application. To query this database, you need to install RStudio
and the shiny package.
